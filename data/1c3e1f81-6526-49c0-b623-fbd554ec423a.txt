AB Purpose To compare the strength of 6-strand Lim-Tsai repair with
   4-strand cruciate and Becker repair, which were done using braided
   polyblend. We hypothesized that the biomechanical strength of 4-strand
   repair could be as strong as 6-strand repair because of different flexor
   tendon repair configurations and uneven load bearing.
   Methods We harvested 60 porcine flexor tendons. A transverse cut at the
   middle of the tendons was made to perfoint tendon repair. Six-strand
   Lim-Tsai repair (consisting of 2 Lim-Tsai locking loops), 4-strand
   cruciate repair (with 3 cross-stitch loops), and 4-strand Becker repair
   (with 2 double cross-stitch locking loops) were used for the repairs.
   The repaired tendons were pulled until failure using a mechanical
   tester. We recorded ultimate tensile strength, load to 2-mm gap force,
   stiffness, and mechanism of failure.
   Results The Becker repairs had significantly greater tensile strength
   than the cruciate and Lim-Tsai repairs. The load to 2-mm gap force and
   stiffness were significantly greater for cruciate repairs and Becker
   repairs than Lim-Tsai repairs.
   Conclusions The biomechanical strength of 4-strand and Becker repairs
   could be as strong as 6-strand Lim-Tsai repairs. This study implies that
   the number of strands crossing the repair site of tendons may not be
   proportional to the biomechanical strength of flexor tendon repair.
   Clinical relevance Hand surgeons are urged to be aware of the
   biomechanic characteristics of different flexor tendon repair techniques
   used in the clinical setting. Copyright (C) 2015 by the American Society

TI Finite element analysis of the stability of transverse acetabular
   fractures in standing and sitting positions by different fixation

AB Background: Treatment of a transverse acetabular fracture type is
   possible from an anterior approach, a posterior approach or both.
   Different fixation methods have been described but whether one is
   superior to the other is still under debate. The aim of the current
   study was to test the different fixation alternatives of stabilization
   of transverse acetabular fractures under two basic physiological loading
   conditions: standing and sitting utilizing a finite element model.
   Material and methods: A transtectal transverse fracture model was fixed
   in five different alternatives: an anterior column plate; a posterior
   column plate; an anterior column plate combined with a posterior column
   screw; a posterior column plate combined with an anterior column screw;
   and a posterior column plate and an anterior column plate. In these
   models, a load of 400 N was applied at standing and sitting positions
   and the displacements were analyzed by using three-dimensional finite
   element stress analysis method.
   Results: In the model simulating standing human position, overall motion
   at the posterior column was minimum when two columns were plated (0.071
   mm). The second best fixation was posterior column plate with an
   anterior column screw (0.077 mm). Overall motion at the anterior column
   was minimum by posterior column plate with an anterior column screw
   (0.0326 mm). The plating of two columns was associated with motion of
   (0.0333 mm).
   In the model that simulates sitting position, the motion at the
   posterior column was minimum when two columns were plated (0.0478 mm),
   and (0.0517 mm) when a posterior column plate with an anterior column
   screw was used. Overall motion in the anterior column was minimum when
   posterior column plate with an anterior column screw (0.0198 mm) was
   used, whereas the motion was (0.0203 mm) when plating of both columns
   was examined.
   Conclusion: Posterior column plating combined with an anterior column
   screw has quite comparable results to a both column plating in
   transverse fractures, suggesting that two column fixations might be
   unnecessary. This method is also very superior to anterior column
   plating combined with a posterior column screw in that type of
   fractures. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Metatarsocuneiform (MTC) fusion is a treatment option for
   management of hallux valgus. We compared the biomechanical
   characteristics of an internal fixation device with plantar plate
   fixation.
   Methods: Seven matched pairs of feet from human cadavers were used to
   compare the intramedullary (IM) device plus compression screw to plantar
   plate combined with a compression screw. Specimen constructs were loaded
   in a cyclic 4-point bending test. We obtained initial/final stiffness,
   maximum load, and number of cycles to failure. Bone mineral density was
   measured with peripheral quantitative computed tomography. Performance
   was compared using time to event analysis with number of cycles as time
   variable, and a proportional hazard model including shared frailty model
   fitted with treatment and bone mineral density as covariates.
   Results: On average the plates failed after 7517 cycles and a maximum
   load of 167 N, while the IM-implants failed on average after 2946 cycles
   and a maximum load of 69 N. In all pairs the 1 treated with IM-implant
   failed earlier than the 1 treated with a plate (hazard ratio for
   IM-implant versus plate was 79.9 (95% confidence interval [6.1, 1052.2],
   P = .0009). The initial stiffness was 131 N/mm for the plantar plate and
   43.3 N/mm for the IM implant. Initial stiffness (r = .955) and final
   stiffness (r = .952) were strongly related to the number of cycles to
   failure. Bone mineral density had no effect on the number of cycles to
   failure.
   Conclusion: Plantar plate fixation created a stronger and stiffer
   construct than IM fixation.
