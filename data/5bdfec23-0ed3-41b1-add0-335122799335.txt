AB This study applies a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis to data from the Global Innovation Index (GII). Building on the National Innovation System's approach, this study posits that a country can achieve high innovation performance via several combinations of causal conditions. These conditions are the five input enablers of GII: institutions, human capital and research, infrastructure, market sophistication, and business sophistication. By defining two subsamples of countries (high-income and low-income), this study finds that several causal combinations of conditions lead to high innovation performance in both groups. In order to obtain better innovation performance, the low-income countries show more multifaceted solutions. These results indicate that none of the conditions is necessary for predicting high innovation performance in both samples. Additionally, in the low-income group, none of the conditions, individually, is sufficient to predict higher innovation performance, while in the high-income group the infrastructure and human capital and research conditions, on their own, are sufficient to obtain better innovation performance. These results indicate that the political decision making processes required for improving the level of innovation need to be different for each group of countries. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB A shift to organic farming in the agricultural sector is a process of building a new system where on the one hand, agro-innovations are generated and on the other, farmers adopt and use them instead of agrochemical materials for sustainability. This study examines local governance (state-led versus community-led modes) and spatial conditions (urban fringe versus rural areas) of four adoption modes of organic farming in the agricultural sector. Local governance affects the ways of mobilizing resources for the diffusion of innovation, while spatial location represents available regional resources. A comparative case study using qualitative semi-structured interviews and national statistics in four Korean agricultural regions was conducted to understand the four adoption modes along two dimensions. The results confirm the usefulness of the typology in describing heterogeneous adoption modes and the complementary effect between governance and spatial location.

AB Background: Economic considerations and the requirement to ensure the quality, safety and integration of research with health and social care provision have given rise to local developments of collaborative organisational forms and strategies to span the translational gaps. One such model - the Health Integration Team (HIT) model in Bristol in the United Kingdom (UK) - brings together National Health Service (NHS) organisations, universities, local authorities, patients and the public to facilitate the systematic application of evidence to promote integration across healthcare pathways. This study aimed to (1) provide empirical evidence documenting the evolution of the model; (2) to identify the social and organisational processes and theory of change underlying healthcare knowledge and practice; and (3) elucidate the key aspects of the HIT model for future development and translation to other localities.
   Methods: Contemporaneous documents were analysed, using procedures associated with Framework Analysis to produce summarised data for descriptive accounts. In-depth interviews were undertaken with key informants and analysed thematically. Comparative methods were applied to further analyse the two data sets.
   Results: One hundred forty documents were analysed and 10 interviews conducted with individuals in leadership positions in the universities, NHS commissioning and provider organisations involved in the design and implementation of the HIT model. Data coalesced around four overarching themes: 'Whole system' engagement, requiring the active recruitment of all those who have a stake in the area of practice being considered, and 'collaboration' to enable coproduction were identified as 'process' themes. System-level integration and innovation were identified as potential 'outcomes' with far-reaching impacts on population health and service delivery.
   Conclusion: The HIT model emerged as a particular response to the perceived need for integration of research and practice to improve public health and healthcare delivery at a time of considerable organisational turmoil and financial constraints. The concept gained momentum and will likely be of interest to those involved in setting up similar arrangements, and researchers in the social and implementation sciences with an interest in their evaluation.

AB In the present study we have examined the Directive 2010/64/EU of the European Parliament and the Council, the European legal instrument governing the right to interpretation and translation within criminal proceedings in the European Union. The innovations in this paper concern the examination of the regulatory way of the mentioned two rights, the formulated critical opinions and the proposals of de lege ferenda. The value of the paper lies in the de lege ferenda proposals, which that can contribute to improving the system of European legislation in the field, which in the constant interpretation of the ECHR it also requires respecting the right to interpretation and translation in ongoing criminal proceedings. Also, the examination highlights the importance and necessity of adopting this European legal instrument regarding the harmonization of the national laws in terms of compulsoriness and the procedure for complying with the two rights to which we referred, in case where the suspect or the accused is to be judged of the territory of a Member State other than his State of origin. The work can be useful to theorists, practitioners and to the European legislator from the perspective of operating the suggested changes.

AB The article provides comparative characteristics of the level of innovation development in the EU member countries and Ukraine based on official statistics and international rankings. The authors have identified the factors which constrain the implementation of innovations and impede competitiveness in Ukraine. They are insufficient demand for innovation; lack of development institutions; a small number of highly qualified innovation managers capable of working in the innovation sector; lack of consistency of state educational, scientific, technological, industrial and innovation policies. The present work covers the best policies of the European Union related to the formation of innovative space in the EU, as well as mechanisms for the regions' "smart policies" implementation to ensure the realisation of their potential.
   The author has made the proposals related to the ways of narrowing the gap in innovation development between the EU and Ukraine, including the formation of an institutional framework for interaction between the state and private companies in order to provide the implementation of innovative development programmes, regional programmes of assistance to small businesses and specific projects within the relevant state programmes developed for high-tech sectors. It is proved that borrowing the best practices of the EU member countries in addressing strategic and tactical problems on the formation of the national innovation system will be a catalyst of innovation development of Ukraine narrowing the gap at the stage of formation of knowledge economy.

AB The USA is a leading country while China is an up-and-coming one in nanotechnology. We carried out a cross-country comparative study on policy and innovation of the two countries in subset nanoenergy field. They both created favorable policy environments for nanotechnology involving applications of nanotechnology in the energy sector. However, Chinese policy deployments for nanotechnology lack coordinated arrangements and effective assessment mechanisms. China performs better than the USA in technological quantity, but weaker in technological influence. The USA expresses an industry-oriented model in nanoenergy technological research and development, but China exhibits a university-and-institute-oriented model. Interorganizational collaboration relationships in the two countries are both still very rare and have huge development space. They both have a long way to go in converting their technological achievements into commercial products, especially China. Finally, we provide the policy implications of this study. In particular, the Chinese government should strengthen its efforts in policies by changing the national S&T evaluation system to set up the basic idea that quality is better than quantity in order to raise the original innovation motivations of innovators.

TI REIMBURSEMENT OF CELL-BASED REGENERATIVE THERAPY IN THE UK AND FRANCE
SO MEDICAL LAW REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
DE Regenerative therapy; Pricing; reimbursement; Access; England; France
AB Cell-based regenerative therapies are presented as being able to cure the diseases of the twenty-first century, especially those coming from the degeneration of the aging human body. But their specific nature based on biological materials raises particular challenging issues on how regulation should frame biomedical innovation for society's benefit regarding public health. The European Union (EU) supports the development of cell-based regenerative therapies that are medicinal products with a specific regulation providing their wide access to the European market for European patients. However, once these medicinal products have obtained a European marketing authorisation, they are still far away from being fully accessible to European patients in all EU Member States. Whereas there is much written on the EU regulatory system for new biotechnologies, there is no systematic legal study comparing the insurance provisions in two EU countries. Focussing on the situation in the UK and France that are based on two different healthcare systems, this paper is based on a comparative methodological approach. It raises the question of regulatory reimbursement mechanisms that determine access to innovative treatments and their consequences for social protection systems in the general context of public health. After having compared the French and English regulations of cell-based regenerative therapy regarding pricing and reimbursement, this papers analyses how England and France are addressing two main challenges of cell-based regenerative therapy, to take into account their long-term benefit through their potential curative nature and their high upfront cost, towards their adoption within the English and French healthcare systems. It concludes that England and France have different general legal frameworks that are not specific to the reimbursement of cell-based regenerative therapy, although their two current and respective trends would bring more convergence between the two systems while addressing the main challenges for the reimbursement of these therapies. Nevertheless, despite their current differences, neither the English nor the French national healthcare system has yet approved the reimbursement of cell-based regenerative therapies. The paper highlights where both systems could be learning from each others' experiences to favour the adoption of cell-based regenerative therapies through the adaptation of their reimbursement methodologies. It also emphasises the gap between market access and patients' access, and it calls for research and discussions through reflexive agencies such as the Regenerative Medicine Expert Group in the UK.

   Innovation in China
SO MANAGEMENT AND ORGANIZATION REVIEW
LA English
DT Article

ID ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT; EUROPE; PERFORMANCE; BUSINESS; SCIENCE
AB This paper discusses some aspects of innovation in China. As China seeks to transition to a knowledge-based economy, it may become more important for China to develop innovative technologies to sustain economic growth. How do China's history, culture, institutions, and organizations aid or hinder innovation? How does China's national innovation system compare to the innovation culture in the US, as well as other developed and emerging economies? What are the prospects for the future of the Chinese national innovation system?
   Our starting point is the Needham Puzzle - the paradox that while China was once a world leader in technological development, it fell behind; the Industrial Revolution happened in Europe rather than in China. Potential explanations for the Needham Puzzle may shed light on the challenges facing innovation in modern China. We identify three factors that might help explain the Needham Puzzle; assess how the Needham Puzzle and Chinese culture and history have affected the modern innovation system; discuss comparative aspects of innovation ecosystems in the United States and elsewhere; and suggest that Chinese innovation emphasizes exploitation and refinement of existing knowledge to the exploration and development of new knowledge. We also discuss implications for the future of innovation in China.

DE Apprenticeships; Stakeholders; Academisation; Dual system; VET reform
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to compare stakeholders' roles in Germany and Switzerland when it comes to promoting innovation in the dual apprenticeship model. In both countries, the relevant stakeholders who represent the various occupations and, in a more narrow sense, the social partners, actively shape vocational education and training (VET) reforms. They represent the area of public educational policy, besides governments, political parties and the public, who, in both countries, appreciate the decisive role of apprenticeships for youth education, employment and social stability. Thus, the broad consensus of the relevant stakeholders is crucial in order to keep apprenticeship systems alive. Both countries face challenges related to academisation, which means, that the Gymnasium (high school) and higher education now are even more the first option for parents than in former times. On several levels German and Swiss policy makers try to strengthen VET paying tribute to and trying to cope with these developments.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper is situated in the field of comparative VET research. Based on policy documents and findings from research the paper analyses the discourse and perspectives related to VET reforms. The authors deliberately focus on two countries, Germany and Switzerland, which share a great deal of common features in relation to VET, nevertheless developed different measures in order to cope with the pressure of increasing the ratio of students in higher education. The comparative paper looks at the topical reform discourse and taken measures and the specific culture of apprenticeships in the two countries by focusing on those stakeholders, which, besides governments, are crucially involved in the system. The paper draws its insights from the VET policy debate and from both national policy documents and national and international expert publications in the field of VET. A strong focus is given to the emerging new environment of the VET system. Methodologically, the paper draws from an institutional view on VET, which is being discussed broadly in comparative research, since VET systems with a "dual system", such as the two discussed here, may be categorized as "state-steered market models", "occupation-based qualifications styles", "collective skill formation systems" or specific realizations of "transition systems". All these categories refer to the observation that in these societies it is not the state alone, who defines the structure of the respective VET system, but non-state stakeholders are capable of influencing VET policy and VET reform in a substantial and visible way.
   Findings - In both countries, Germany and Switzerland, the importance and value of VET is based on an overall consensus, shared by all relevant actors. The basis of this consensus is that the dual system so far successfully opened and should continue to open career paths in industry. Apprenticeships undoubtedly are cornerstones of economic welfare in these countries and can be associated with low youth unemployment rates. A supplementary aspect in the last years however is the political will that VET should also have some kind of link with higher education. Despite some interesting reform measures ambivalences cannot be ignored: against what could be called "academic fallacy" the importance of a highly qualified workforce, trained in non-academic fields, and the future of this kind of skill formation have become major topics and concerns in both societies.
   Originality/value - This paper is comparing two similar cases, Switzerland and Germany, in VET in order to profile reform alternatives. Furthermore the actors beyond state are highlighted as important element for reform in VET education.

DT Article
DE Environmental; Health systems; Primary care
AB This article describes the contributions of Chilean physician San Martin Ferrari (1915-200), arguing that they constitute important cornerstones in collective health in Brazil, Latin America, and the Iberian Peninsula. His work is reviewed, establishing a dialog with the current theoretical research in this field and the context of contemporary health systems. Two main aspects are emphasized: the innovation of San Martin in insisting on the importance of analyses that incorporate the relationship between environment and health; and his role in the creation of the Chilean and the Spanish National Health Services. Although they arose in distinct moments and had different trajectories, these systems constitute examples for the creation of universal public health systems, such as the Brazilian health reform and the ongoing challenge to improve the Unified Health System. The analysis of his work and biography contribute elements for the comparative study of these reforms, as well as an eco-systemic approach to health.
