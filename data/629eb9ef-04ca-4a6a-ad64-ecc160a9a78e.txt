AB This paper presents a dynamic logistics model for medical resources allocation that can be used to control an epidemic diffusion. It couples a forecasting mechanism, constructed for the demand of a medicine in the course of such epidemic diffusion, and a logistics planning system to satisfy the forecasted demand and minimize the total cost. The forecasting mechanism is a time discretized version of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered model that is widely employed in predicting the trajectory of an epidemic diffusion. The logistics planning system is formulated as a mixed 0-1 integer programming problem characterizing the decision making at various levels of hospitals, distribution centers, pharmaceutical plants, and the transportation in between them. The model is built as a closed-loop cycle, comprising forecast phase, planning phase, execution phase, and adjustment phase. The parameters of the forecast mechanism are adjusted in reflection of the real data collected in the execution phase by solving a quadratic programming problem. A numerical example is presented to verify efficiency of the model.

AB Objective: To develop a mathematical model of predicting mortality based on the admission characteristics of 6220 burn cases.
   Methods: Data on all the burn patients presenting to Institute of Burn Research, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University from January of 1999 to December of 2008 were extracted from the departmental registry. The distributions of burn cases were scattered by principal component analysis. Univariate associations with mortality were identified and independent associations were derived from multivariate logistic regression analysis. Using variables independently and significantly associated with mortality, a mathematical model to predict mortality was developed using the support vector machine (SVM) model. The predicting ability of this model was evaluated and verified.
   Results: The overall mortality in this study was 1.8%. Univariate associations with mortality were identified and independent associations were derived from multivariate logistic regression analysis. Variables at admission independently associated with mortality were gender, age, total burn area, full thickness burn area, inhalation injury, shock, period before admission and others. The sensitivity and specificity of logistic model were 99.75% and 85.84% respectively, with an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.989 (95% CI: 0.979-1.000; p < 0.01). The model correctly classified 99.50% of cases. The subsequently developed support vector machine (SVM) model correctly classified nearly 100% of test cases, which could not only predict adult group but also pediatric group, with pretty high robustness (92%-100%).
   Conclusion: A mathematical model based on logistic regression and SVM could be used to predict the survival prognosis according to the admission characteristics. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The Logistic Clinical Syntax Score (log CSS) is a combined risk scoring system that includes clinical and anatomic parameters; it has been found to be effective for the prediction of mortality in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The aim of the present study was to assess whether the log CSS was associated with the development of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) in patients who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI).
   Methods: A total of 930 patients with STEMI undergoing pPCI between January 2012 and August 2013 were included prospectively. The patients were grouped according to the development of CIN. Either an absolute serum creatinine level >= 0.5 mg/dL or a 25% increase in the serum creatinine level compared with the baseline level within 48 hours after the administration of contrast medium was defined as CIN.
   Results: The Synergy Between Percutaneous Coronary Interventions With Taxus and Cardiac Surgery score (SYNTAX [SS]) and log CSS were higher in patients with CIN than in those without. In the multivariate analysis, log CSS (odds ratio, 1.405, 95% confidence interval, 1.318-1.497; P < 0.001), hemoglobin, and contrast volume were found to be independent predictors of CIN. In the receiver operating characteristic analysis, a log CSS > 9.5 had a 74.5% sensitivity and a 90.5% specificity for predicting CIN, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.892, whereas an SS > 18.5 had a 64% sensitivity, a 58.1% specificity, and an AUC of 0.625 (0.892 vs 0.625; P < 0.001). A log CSS > 9.5 was associated with in-hospital and long-term mortality, reinfarction, revascularization, and in-hospital hemodialysis (P < 0.001 for each).
   Conclusions: The log CSS may improve the accuracy of risk stratification for the development of CIN in patients undergoing pPCI.

AB Background. Reporting of surgical complications is common, but few provide information about the severity and estimate risk factors of complications. If have, but lack of specificity. Methods. We retrospectively analyzed data on 2795 gastric cancer patients underwent surgical procedure at the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University between June 2007 and June 2012, established multivariate logistic regression model to predictive risk factors related to the postoperative complications according to the Clavien-Dindo classification system. Results. Twenty-four out of 86 variables were identified statistically significant in univariate logistic regression analysis, 11 significant variables entered multivariate analysis were employed to produce the risk model. Liver cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, Child classification, invasion of neighboring organs, combined resection, introperative transfusion, Billroth II anastomosis of reconstruction, malnutrition, surgical volume of surgeons, operating time and age were independent risk factors for postoperative complications after gastrectomy. Based on logistic regression equation, p=Exp n-ary sumation BiXi / (1+Exp n-ary sumation BiXi), multivariate logistic regression predictive model that calculated the risk of postoperative morbidity was developed, p = 1/(1 + e((4.810-1.287X1-0.504X2-0.500X3-0.474X4-0.405X5-0.318X6-0.316X7-0.305X8-0.278X9-0.255X10-0.138X11))). The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the model to predict the postoperative complications were 86.7%, 76.2% and 88.6%, respectively. Conclusions. This risk model based on Clavien-Dindo grading severity of complications system and logistic regression analysis can predict severe morbidity specific to an individual patient's risk factors, estimate patients' risks and benefits of gastric surgery as an accurate decision-making tool and may serve as a template for the development of risk models for other surgical groups.

AB The construction supply chain is of temporary nature and complex, with many interactions between multiple actors in different construction projects. This challenging context typically leads to relatively higher costs and lower productivity, compared to other industries. Supply chain management (SCM) has been put forward as a mean to better handle this challenging context. As a part of SCM initiatives some construction industry stakeholders have turned to third-party logistics (TPL) providers, especially in large construction projects. The use of TPL providers is a new, and under-investigated, phenomenon in the construction industry. The main purpose of this study is thus to explore the use of a TPL provider in a large construction project and to analyse its resulting effects. Driving forces and possible concerns for implementing TPL are identified and the possibility for TPL to be a facilitator for implementing SCM in construction is investigated. The research is based on a literature review and an explorative case study of a large hospital project in Sweden, where the client and the main contractor have initiated the use of a TPL provider to coordinate sourcing and materials handling activities on site. The results show positive effects on establishing an effective interface between the construction site and the supply chain. The results also show that a TPL solution facilitates an increase in productive work at the construction site itself, a reduction of costs and an increased utilisation of site assets. On the downside, the study also shows a lack of SCM knowledge amongst the involved actors in the project, hindering them to reap the full potential of TPL.

AB Background: In recent years, the prevalence of hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) in China and some other countries has caused worldwide concern. Mild cases tend to recover within a week, while severe cases may progress rapidly and tend to have bad outcome. Since there is no vaccine for HFMD and anti-inflammatory treatment is not ideal. In this study, we aimed to establish a valid forecasting model for severe HFMD using common laboratory parameters.
   Methods: Retrospectively, 77 severe HFMD cases from Zhengzhou Children's hospital in the peaking period between years 2013 to 2015 were collected, with 77 mild HFMD cases in the same area. The study recorded common laboratory parameters to assist in establishment of the severe HFMD model. After screening the important variables using Mann-Whitney U test, the study also matched the logistic regression (LR), discriminant analysis (DA), and decision tree (DT) to make a comparison.
   Results: Compared with that of the mild group, serum levels of WBC, PLT, PCT, MCV, MCH, LCR, SCR, LCC, GLO, CK-MB, K, S100, and B in the severe group were higher (p < 0.05), while MCR, EOR, BASOR, SCC, MCC, EO, BASO, NA, CL, T, Th, and Th/Ts were lower (p < 0.05). Five indicators including MCR, LCC, Th, CK-MB, and CL were screened out by LR and the same for DA, and five variables including EO, LCC, CL, GLO, and MCC screened out by DT. The area under the curve (AUC) of LR, DA, and DT was 0.805, 0.779 and 0.864, respectively.
   Conclusions: The findings were that common laboratory indexes were effectively used to distinguish the mild HFMD cases and severe HFMD cases by LR, DA, and DT, and DT had the best classification effect with an AUC of 0.864.

AB Purpose - The drug logistics play a crucial role in the hospital service performance. It has been proved that modern logistics concept is a valid access to competitiveness. In order to enhance the comprehensive capability and core competence of hospitals, including the internal support system, there is a great need to have an in-depth and systematic study on the drug logistics system in hospitals. The purpose of this paper is to explore the current situation of the drug logistics and the drug centres operations in public hospitals in China; specifically how the organizational partnerships with the supply chain partners can affect the operational performance.
   Design/methodology/approach - In this study, the possibility of correlations between schedule instability, partnerships with supply chain partners, and internal drug logistics operation is investigated by modelling, with reference to the previous work of Law et al. (2009), in which collective efficacy of the performance is incorporated into the model.
   Findings - The findings of this study show that the drug logistics working teams in public hospitals in China have a high level of efficacy and self-confidence, while they perceive they provide good operations even at a low level of schedule nervousness. The study also reinforces the significant correlation between internal operation and partnership with customers. This is definitely useful for the development of an appropriate framework for drug logistics operation improvement in the long run.
   Originality/value - The study thus offers a good reference for the administrators and practitioners who are keen on improving the service operations in the healthcare sector in the region.

TI Comprehensible Predictive Modeling Using Regularized Logistic Regression
   and Comorbidity Based Features
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID SELECTION; LASSO
AB Different studies have demonstrated the importance of comorbidities to better understand the origin and evolution of medical complications. This study focuses on improvement of the predictive model interpretability based on simple logical features representing comorbidities. We use group lasso based feature interaction discovery followed by a post-processing step, where simple logic terms are added. In the final step, we reduce the feature set by applying lasso logistic regression to obtain a compact set of non-zero coefficients that represent a more comprehensible predictive model. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was demonstrated on a pediatric hospital discharge dataset that was used to build a readmission risk estimation model. The evaluation of the proposed method demonstrates a reduction of the initial set of features in a regression model by 72%, with a slight improvement in the Area Under the ROC Curve metric from 0.763 (95% CI: 0.755-0.771) to 0.769 (95% CI: 0.761-0.777). Additionally, our results show improvement in comprehensibility of the final predictive model using simple comorbidity based terms for logistic regression.

AB Aim: To investigate the effect of age, gender, address, type of extraction, type of operator and the arch of the tooth involved in the occurrence of dry sockets. A secondary aim of the study was to calculate the incidence of dry sockets in Islamabad, Pakistan.
   Materials and methods: This study was conducted in the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Department at Islamic International Dental Hospital from April till May 2013. Data were collected for any complaints of dry socket following tooth extractions, by means of a structured questionnaire. All patients above 18 years of age were included. Mean and standard deviation were calculated for age. Frequencies were calculated for gender, address, operator type, arch and the outcome (occurrence of dry socket). A binary logistic regression analysis was conducted to establish a risk model to relate the variables with the occurrence of dry socket. Pearson's Chi-square test was applied to assess the frequency of occurrence with age.
   Results: Out of 1670 patients, 1563 adults fulfilled the inclusion criteria. 80 patients reported with dry socket, the incidence being 5.12%. Logistic regression analysis showed a statistically significant association between age and the development of dry socket (OR = 0.953, 95% CI = 0.926-0.961). None of the other factors had a significant association with the occurrence of dry sockets.
   Conclusion: A significant association exists between patient's age and development of dry socket. An inverse relationship was noted between the increase in age and occurrence of dry socket. No such association is noted between patient gender, address of the patient, location of the tooth, operator and extraction type. (C) 2015 Asian AOMS, ASOMP, JSOP, JSOMS, JSOM, and JAMI.

AB This study was conducted to evaluate the relationship between air pollutants (including nitrogen oxides [NO, NO2, NOX], sulfur dioxide [SO2], carbon monoxide [CO], ozone [O-3], and particulate matter of median aerometric diameter < 10 mu m [PM10]) and hospital admissions for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. The study had a case-crossover design which was conducted in Tabriz, Iran. Daily hospital admissions and air quality data from March 2009 to March 2011 were analyzed using the artificial neural networks (ANNs) and conditional logistic regression modeling. The results showed significant associations between gaseous air pollutants including NO2, O-3, and NO and hospital admissions for cardiovascular disease. Gaseous air pollutants of NO2, NO, and CO were associated with hospital admissions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, while PM10 was associated with hospitalizations due to respiratory infections. PM10 and O-3 were also associated with asthmatic hospital admissions. There was no significant association between SO2 and studied health outcomes. Comparing the results of logistic regressions and ANNs confirmed the optimality of the ANNs for detection of the best predictors of hospital admissions caused by air pollution. Further research is required to investigate the effects of seasonal variations on air pollution-related health outcomes.

AB Background: Predictive models for delayed graft function (DGF) after kidney transplantation are usually developed using logistic regression. We want to evaluate the value of machine learning methods in the prediction of DGF.
   Methods: 497 kidney transplantations from deceased donors at the Ghent University Hospital between 2005 and 2011 are included. A feature elimination procedure is applied to determine the optimal number of features, resulting in 20 selected parameters (24 parameters after conversion to indicator parameters) out of 55 retrospectively collected parameters. Subsequently, 9 distinct types of predictive models are fitted using the reduced data set: logistic regression (LR), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), support vector machines (SVMs; using linear, radial basis function and polynomial kernels), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and stochastic gradient boosting (SGB). Performance of the models is assessed by computing sensitivity, positive predictive values and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) after 10-fold stratified cross-validation. AUROCs of the models are pairwise compared using Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
   Results: The observed incidence of DGF is 12.5 %. DT is not able to discriminate between recipients with and without DGF (AUROC of 52.5 %) and is inferior to the other methods. SGB, RF and polynomial SVM are mainly able to identify recipients without DGF (AUROC of 77.2, 73.9 and 79.8 %, respectively) and only outperform DT. LDA, QDA, radial SVM and LR also have the ability to identify recipients with DGF, resulting in higher discriminative capacity (AUROC of 82.2, 79.6, 83.3 and 81.7 %, respectively), which outperforms DT and RF. Linear SVM has the highest discriminative capacity (AUROC of 84.3 %), outperforming each method, except for radial SVM, polynomial SVM and LDA. However, it is the only method superior to LR.
   Conclusions: The discriminative capacities of LDA, linear SVM, radial SVM and LR are the only ones above 80 %. None of the pairwise AUROC comparisons between these models is statistically significant, except linear SVM outperforming LR. Additionally, the sensitivity of linear SVM to identify recipients with DGF is amongst the three highest of all models. Due to both reasons, the authors believe that linear SVM is most appropriate to predict DGF.

AB Drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) is a rapidly growing method to evaluate airway collapse in patients receiving non-CPAP therapies for sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). The growing number of DISEs has consequences for the organization of clinical protocols. In this paper we present our recent experiences with DISE, performed by an ENT resident, with sedation given by a nurse anesthetist, in an outpatient endoscopy setting, while the staff member/sleep surgeon discusses the findings and the recommended treatment proposal on the same day.

AB Background: Free tissue transfer using fasciocutaneous flaps has increased in frequency over the past decade. Predictive analyses are lacking for fasciocutaneous free flaps in terms of complication rates for reconstruction. This study therefore was designed to identify key variables that drive complications in fasciocutaneous free flap surgery.
   Methods: A retroactive chart review of 91 patients undergoing 91 fasciocutaneous flaps was performed. Twelve variables were identified and tracked through clinic and hospital charts (i.e., surgeon experience, hospital, age, flap type, traumatic wound, smoking, large fasciocutaneous flap, type of anastomosis, recipient vessel choice, sex, anatomical region of wound, and flap debulking). A logistic regression model was used to determine the presence of complications associated with the prescribed predictors.
   Results: The model revealed that smoking, age, anatomical area of wound, flap size, flap type, and presence of a traumatic wound impacted complications. The model was found to be a good fit (Hosmer-Lemeshow, p = 0.135). Factors impacting complications with fasciocutaneous flaps included anatomical area (62.3 percent increase in complications; p = 0.047), surgeon experience (27 percent reduction in complications; p = 0.007), and reconstruction of a trauma activation patient (80 percent reduction in complications; p = 0.025).
   Conclusion: The implications of these findings can be used to contain cost and minimize poor outcomes within the health care system.

AB We propose an optimization model for patient delivery and medical resource allocation with capacity restrictions. Our model considers the severity of the victims' injuries in the initial search and rescue period and their survival probabilities, which decrease proportionally with the elapsed time. We develop a mixed integer programming model to select the location and network flow of an on-site clinic for supporting first-aid treatment near disaster areas. We also build a model of a general hospital as an objective function to maximize the number of patients whose survival probability exceeds the marginal level. Our model also considers patients waiting at the on-site clinic and hospital. We apply our optimization approach in a case study with data from a department store collapse in South Korea. Our computational results will facilitate future studies of logistics to support wounded victims of disasters.

AB This study aimed to create an appropriate model using verbal autopsy (VA) data to estimate transport accident deaths from vital registration data in Thailand. A sample of 9644 VA deaths was obtained from the Thai Ministry of Public Health. VA assessed transport accidents accounted for 546 deaths (5.7% of sample). Logistic regression was used to model transport accident deaths classified by 9 provinces, 16 gender-age groups, 14 combinations of vital reported cause groups, and place of death (in or outside hospital). The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to match the number of reported transport accident deaths to the number predicted by the model with sensitivity 73.8% and false positive rate 1.6%. The estimated transport accident deaths ranged from 1.68 to 2.65 times higher than the vital registration data reported according to gender-age groups.

AB In the age of rising patients' self-awareness, reducing patient waiting time is one of the most important issues for hospitals. In Taiwan, the schedule of outpatient appointment time is arranged according to experience, and several possible factors influential to the prediction accuracy are neglected, which inducing patient's uncomfortable feeling. In this paper, sample data of a medical center located in central Taiwan is collected. Three methods for predicting the outpatient appointment time were conducted and compared, including the hospital's method, the moving average method, and the logistic regression method. The experimental results show that the appointment scheduling system based on our proposed algorithm can efficiently improve service quality by increasing prediction accuracy on the outpatient appointment time.

AB Introduction: This article is part of the Focus Theme of Methods of Information in Medicine on "Big Data and Analytics in Healthcare".
   Background: Hospital readmissions raise healthcare costs and cause significant distress to providers and patients. It is, therefore, of great interest to healthcare organizations to predict what patients are at risk to be readmitted to their hospitals. However, current logistic regression based risk prediction models have limited prediction power when applied to hospital administrative data. Meanwhile, although decision trees and random forests have been applied, they tend to be too complex to understand among the hospital practitioners.
   Objectives: Explore the use of conditional logistic regression to increase the prediction accuracy.
   Methods: We analyzed an HCUP statewide inpatient discharge record dataset, which includes patient demographics, clinical and care utilization data from California. We extracted records of heart failure Medicare beneficiaries who had inpatient experience during an 11-month period. We corrected the data imbalance issue with under-sampling. In our study, we first applied standard logistic regression and decision tree to obtain influential variables and derive practically meaning decision rules. We then stratified the original data set accordingly and applied logistic regression on each data stratum. We further explored the effect of interacting variables in the logistic regression modeling. We conducted cross validation to assess the overall prediction performance of conditional logistic regression (CLR) and compared it with standard classification models.
   Results: The developed CLR models outperformed several standard classification models (e.g., straightforward logistic regression, stepwise logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine). For example, the best CLR model improved the classification accuracy by nearly 20% over the straightforward logistic regression model. Furthermore, the developed CLR models tend to achieve better sensitivity of more than 10% over the standard classification models, which can be translated to correct labeling of additional 400 - 500 readmissions for heart failure patients in the state of California over a year. Lastly, several key predictor identified from the HCUP data include the disposition location from discharge, the number of chronic conditions, and the number of acute procedures.
   Conclusions: It would be beneficial to apply simple decision rules obtained from the decision tree in an ad-hoc manner to guide the cohort stratification. It could be potentially beneficial to explore the effect of pairwise interactions between influential predictors when building the logistic regression models for different data strata. Judicious use of the ad-hoc CLR models developed offers insights into future development of prediction models for hospital readmissions, which can lead to better intuition in identifying high-risk patients and developing effective post-discharge care strategies. Lastly, this paper is expected to raise the awareness of collecting data on additional markers and developing necessary database infrastructure for larger-scale exploratory studies on readmission risk prediction.

AB Background: Availability and usage of individual IT applications have been studied intensively in the past years. Recently, IT support of clinical processes is attaining increasing attention. The underlying construct that describes the IT support of clinical workflows is clinical information logistics. This construct needs to be better understood, operationalised and measured.
   Objectives: It is therefore the aim of this study to propose and develop a workflow composite score (WCS) for measuring clinical information logistics and to examine its quality based on reliability and validity analyses.
   Methods: We largely followed the procedural model of MacKenzie and colleagues (2011) for defining and conceptualising the construct domain, for developing the measurement instrument, assessing the content validity, pretesting the instrument, specifying the model, capturing the data and computing the WCS and testing the reliability and validity.
   Results: Clinical information logistics was decomposed into the descriptors data and information, function, integration and distribution, which embraced the framework validated by an analysis of the international literature. This framework was refined selecting representative clinical processes. We chose ward rounds, pre- and post-surgery processes and discharge as sample processes that served as concrete instances for the measurements. They are sufficiently complex, represent core clinical processes and involve different professions, departments and settings. The score was computed on the basis of data from 183 hospitals of different size, ownership, location and teaching status. Testing the reliability and validity yielded encouraging results: the reliability was high with r(split-half)=0.89, the WCS discriminated between groups; the WCS correlated significantly and moderately with two EHR models and the WCS received good evaluation results by a sample of chief information officers (n = 67). These findings suggest the further utilisation of the WCS.
   Conclusion: As the WCS does not assume ideal workflows as a gold standard but measures IT support of clinical workflows according to validated descriptors a high portability of the WCS to other hospitals in other countries is very likely. The WCS will contribute to a better understanding of the construct clinical information logistics.

AB Due to the increased incidence of morbid obesity, the demand for bariatric surgery is increasing. Therefore, the methods for optimising perioperative care for the improvement of surgical outcome and to increase efficacy are necessary. The aim of this prospective matched cohort study is to objectify the effect of the fast-track surgery (FTS) programme in patients undergoing primary Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (LRYGB) surgery compared to conventional perioperative care (CPC).
   This study compared the perioperative outcome data of two groups of 75 consecutive morbid obese patients who underwent a primary LRYGB according to international guidelines in the periods January 2011-April 2011 (CPC group) and April 2012-June 2012 (FTS group). The two groups were matched for age and sex. Primary endpoints were surgery and hospitalisation time, while secondary endpoints were intraoperative medication use and complication rates.
   Baseline patient characteristics for age, sex, weight and ASA classification were similar (p > 0.05) for CPC and FTS patients. BMI and waist circumference were significantly lower (p < 0.05) in the FTS compared to CPC. The total time from arrival at the operating room to the arrival at the recovery was reduced from 119 to 82 min (p < 0.001). Surgery time was reduced from 80 to 56 min (p < 0.001); mean hospital stay was reduced from 65 to 43 h (p < 0.001). Major complications occurred in 3 versus 4 % in the FTS and CPC, respectively.
   The introduction of a fast-track programme after primary LRYGB improves short-term recovery and may reduces direct hospital-related resources.

AB Objectives: The logistic European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (LES) score and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) score are validated to predict 30-day outcomes following surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) with or without coronary artery bypass grafting. Their performance when applied to patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is controversial.
   Methods: We compared predicted and observed 30-day/in-hospital and 1-year mortality of patients undergoing TAVR in the first Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves trial and continued access registry (N = 2466). The performance of the LES and STS scores (prospectively calculated) was evaluated using standard assessments of discrimination and calibration. Performance of STS and LES scores among 307 patients undergoing SAVR from the high-risk cohort of the randomized trial were also examined.
   Results: In patients undergoing TAVR, the observed 30-day/in-hospital mortality was 6.5%, whereas the predicted 30-day mortality was higher by both STS score (11.4% +/- 3.9%) and LES score (26.6% +/- 16.2%). The discrimination for both scores was poor for 30-day/in-hospital and 1-year mortality. Calibration was better for STS score than for LES at 1 year but poor for both at 30 days among TAVR cohort. These results were consistent among the subgroups of patients undergoing transfemoral and transapical access; however, the STS score had better performance among the high-risk patients who underwent SAVR at 30 days but not 1 year.
   Conclusions: The STS and LES surgical risk scores overestimated 30-day/in-hospital mortality and were poor discriminators of post-TAVR mortality, but the calibration of the STS score was better in these high-risk patients. These data highlight the need for TAVR-specific risk models to optimize patient selection.

AB It is important for clinical practice and research that measurement scales of well-being and quality of life exhibit only minimal differential item functioning (DIF). DIF occurs where different groups of people endorse items in a scale to different extents after being matched by the intended scale attribute. We investigate the equivalence or otherwise of common methods of assessing DIF.
   Three methods of measuring age- and sex-related DIF (ordinal logistic regression, Rasch analysis and Mantel chi(2) procedure) were applied to Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) data pertaining to a sample of 1,068 patients consulting primary care practitioners.
   Three items were flagged by all three approaches as having either age- or sex-related DIF with a consistent direction of effect; a further three items identified did not meet stricter criteria for important DIF using at least one method. When applying strict criteria for significant DIF, ordinal logistic regression was slightly less sensitive.
   Ordinal logistic regression, Rasch analysis and contingency table methods yielded consistent results when identifying DIF in the HADS depression and HADS anxiety scales. Regardless of methods applied, investigators should use a combination of statistical significance, magnitude of the DIF effect and investigator judgement when interpreting the results.

AB When analyzing longitudinal data, it is essential to account both for the correlation inherent from the repeated measures of the responses as well as the correlation realized on account of the feedback created between the responses at a particular time and the predictors at other times. As such one can analyze these data using generalized estimating equation with the independent working correlation. However, because it is essential to include all the appropriate moment conditions as you solve for the regression coefficients, we explore an alternative approach using a generalized method of moments for estimating the coefficients in such data. We develop an approach that makes use of all the valid moment conditions necessary with each time-dependent and time-independent covariate. This approach does not assume that feedback is always present over time, or if present occur at the same degree. Further, we make use of continuously updating generalized method of moments in obtaining estimates. We fit the generalized method of moments logistic regression model with time-dependent covariates using SAS PROC IML and also in R. We used p-values adjusted for multiple correlated tests to determine the appropriate moment conditions for determining the regression coefficients. We examined two datasets for illustrative purposes. We looked at re-hospitalization taken from a Medicare database. We also revisited data regarding the relationship between the body mass index and future morbidity among children in the Philippines. We conducted a simulated study to compare the performances of extended classifications. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB EuroSCORE II, despite improving on the original EuroSCORE system, has not solved all the calibration and predictability issues. Recursive, non-linear and mixed recursive and non-linear regression analysis were assessed with regard to sensitivity, specificity and predictability of the original EuroSCORE and EuroSCORE II systems.
   The original logistic EuroSCORE, EuroSCORE II and recursive, non-linear and mixed recursive and non-linear regression analyses of these risk models were assessed via receiver operator characteristic curves (ROC) and Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic analysis with regard to the accuracy of predicting in-hospital mortality. Analysis was performed for isolated coronary artery bypass grafts (CABGs) (n = 2913), aortic valve replacement (AVR) (n = 814), mitral valve surgery (n = 340), combined AVR and CABG (n = 517), aortic (n = 350), miscellaneous cases (n = 642), and combinations of the above cases (n = 5576).
   The original EuroSCORE had an ROC below 0.7 for isolated AVR and combined AVR and CABG. None of the methods described increased the ROC above 0.7. The EuroSCORE II risk model had an ROC below 0.7 for isolated AVR only. Recursive regression, non-linear regression, and mixed recursive and non-linear regression all increased the ROC above 0.7 for isolated AVR. The original EuroSCORE had a Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic that was above 0.05 for all patients and the subgroups analysed. All of the techniques markedly increased the Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic. The EuroSCORE II risk model had a Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic that was significant for all patients (P < 0.0001), and very close to significant for isolated CABG (P = 0.05) and for isolated AVR (P = 0.06). Non-linear regression failed to improve on the original Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic. The mixed recursive and non-linear regression using the EuroSCORE II risk model was the only model that produced an ROC of 0.7 or above for all patients and procedures and had a Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic that was highly non-significant.
   The original EuroSCORE and the EuroSCORE II risk models do not have adequate ROC and Hosmer-Lemeshow statistics to allow accurate assessment of cardiac surgeons in the modern era. A mixed recursive and non-linear regression model utilizing the EuroSCORE II risk model improves both the ROC and Hosmer-Lemeshow statistics.

AB The number of emergency (or unplanned) readmissions in the United Kingdom National Health Service (NHS) has been rising for many years. This trend, which is possibly related to poor patient care, places financial pressures on hospitals and on national healthcare budgets. As a result, clinicians and key decision makers (e.g., managers and commissioners) are interested in predicting patients at high risk of readmission. Logistic regression is the most popular method of predicting patient-specific probabilities. However, these studies have produced conflicting results with poor prediction accuracies. We compared the predictive accuracy of logistic regression with that of regression trees for predicting emergency readmissions within 45 days after been discharged from hospital. We also examined the predictive ability of two other types of data-driven models: generalized additive models (GAMs) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS). We used data on 963 patients readmitted to hospitals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma. We used repeated split-sample validation: the data were divided into derivation and validation samples. Predictive models were estimated using the derivation sample and the predictive accuracy of the resultant model was assessed using a number of performance measures, such as area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve in the validation sample. This process was repeated 1,000 timesthe initial data set was divided into derivation and validation samples 1,000 times, and the predictive accuracy of each method was assessed each time. The mean ROC curve area for the regression tree models in the 1,000 derivation samples was .928, while the mean ROC curve area of a logistic regression model was .924. Our study shows that logistic regression model and regression trees had performance comparable to that of more flexible, data-driven models such as GAMs and MARS. Given that the models have produced excellent predictive accuracies, this could be a valuable decision support tool for clinicians (healthcare managers, policy makers, etc.) for informed decision making in the management of diseases, which ultimately contributes to improved measures for hospital performance management.

AB BACKGROUND: Successful management of a pandemic or disaster requires implementation of preexisting plans to minimize loss of life and maintain control. Managing the expected surges in intensive care capacity requires strategic planning from a systems perspective and includes focused intensive care abilities and requirements as well as all individuals and organizations involved in hospital and regional planning. The suggestions in this article are important for all involved in a large-scale disaster or pandemic, including front-line clinicians, hospital administrators, and public health or government officials. Specifically, this article focuses on surge logistics-those elements that provide the capability to deliver mass critical care.
   METHODS: The Surge Capacity topic panel developed 23 key questions focused on the following domains: systems issues; equipment, supplies, and pharmaceuticals; staffing; and informatics. Literature searches were conducted to identify studies upon which evidence-based recommendations could be made. The results were reviewed for relevance to the topic, and the articles were screened by two topic editors for placement within one of the surge domains noted previously. Most reports were small scale, were observational, or used flawed modeling; hence, the level of evidence on which to base recommendations was poor and did not permit the development of evidence-based recommendations. The Surge Capacity topic panel subsequently followed the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) Guidelines Oversight Committee's methodology to develop suggestion based on expert opinion using a modified Delphi process.
   RESULTS: This article presents 22 suggestions pertaining to surge capacity mass critical care, including requirements for equipment, supplies, and pharmaceuticals; staff preparation and organization; methods of mitigating overwhelming patient loads; the role of deployable critical care services; and the use of transportation assets to support the surge response.
   CONCLUSIONS: Critical care response to a disaster relies on careful planning for staff and resource augmentation and involves many agencies. Maximizing the use of regional resources, including staff, equipment, and supplies, extends critical care capabilities. Regional coalitions should be established to facilitate agreements, outline operational plans, and coordinate hospital efforts to achieve predetermined goals. Specialized physician oversight is necessary and if not available on site, may be provided through remote consultation. Triage by experienced providers, reverse triage, and service deescalation may be used to minimize ICU resource consumption. During a temporary loss of infrastructure or overwhelmed hospital resources, deployable critical care services should be considered. CHEST 2014; 146 (4_Suppl): e17S-e43S

AB Objective: To evaluate in-hospital and short-term outcomes of percutaneous mitral valve repair according to patients' logistic EuroSCORE (logEuroSCORE) in a multicenter registry Background: The logEuroSCORE is an established tool to predict the risk of mortality during cardiac surgery. In high-risk patients percutaneous mitral valve repair with the MitraClip system represents a less-invasive alternative Methods: Data from 1002 patients, who underwent percutaneous mitral valve repair with the MitraClip system, were analyzed in the German Transcatheter Mitral Valve Interventions (TRAMI) Registry. A logEuroSCORE (mortality risk in %) >= 20 was considered high risk Results: Of all patients, 557 (55.6%) had a logEuroSCORE >= 20. Implantation of the MitraClip was successful in 95.5 % (942/986) patients. Moderate residual mitral valve regurgitation was more often detected in patients with a logEuroSCORE >= 20 (23.8% vs. 17.1%, respectively, P < 0.05). In patients with a logEuroSCORE >= 20 the procedural complication rate was 8.9% (vs. 6.4, n.s.) and the in-hospital MACCE rate 4.9% (vs. 1.4% P < 0.01). The in-hospital mortality rate in patients with a logEuroSCORE >= 20 and logEuroSCORE < 20 was 4.3 and 1.1%, respectively (P <= 0.01) Conclusion: Percutaneous mitral valve repair with the MitraClip system is feasible in patients with a logEuroSCORE >= 20 with similar procedural results compared to patients with lower predicted risk. Although mortality was four times higher than in patients with logEuroSCORE < 20, mortality in high risk patients was lower than predicted. In those with a logEuroSCORE >= 20, moderate residual mitral valve regurgitation was more frequent. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The aim of the paper is to use data mining technology to establish a classification of breast cancer survival patterns, and offers a treatment decision-making reference for the survival ability of women diagnosed with breast cancer in Taiwan. We studied patients with breast cancer in a specific hospital in Central Taiwan to obtain 1,340 data sets. We employed a support vector machine, logistic regression, and a C5.0 decision tree to construct a classification model of breast cancer patients' survival rates, and used a 10-fold cross-validation approach to identify the model. The results show that the establishment of classification tools for the classification of the models yielded an average accuracy rate of more than 90 % for both; the SVM provided the best method for constructing the three categories of the classification system for the survival mode. The results of the experiment show that the three methods used to create the classification system, established a high accuracy rate, predicted a more accurate survival ability of women diagnosed with breast cancer, and could be used as a reference when creating a medical decision-making frame.

AB The paper provides a novel application of the probabilistic reduction (PR) approach to the analysis of multi-categorical outcomes. The PR approach, which systematically takes account of heterogeneity and functional form concerns, can improve the specification of binary regression models. However, its utility for systematically enriching the specification of and inference from models of multi-categorical outcomes has not been examined, while multinomial logistic regression models are commonly used for inference and, increasingly, prediction. Following a theoretical derivation of the PR-based multinomial logistic model (MLM), we compare functional specification and marginal effects from a traditional specification and a PR-based specification in a model of post-stroke hospital discharge disposition and find that the traditional MLM is misspecified. Results suggest that the impact on the reliability of substantive inferences from a misspecified model may be significant, even when model fit statistics do not suggest a strong lack of fit compared with a properly specified model using the PR approach. We identify situations under which a PR-based MLM specification can be advantageous to the applied researcher.

AB Objective: Multiple organ dysfunction, not respiratory failure, is the major cause of death in children with acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome. This study was undertaken to estimate the predictive value of death of the nonrespiratory Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction-2 in children with acute respiratory failure.
   Design: Analysis of the database of the recently published Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction-2.
   Setting: Nine multidisciplinary, tertiary-care PICU of university-affiliated hospitals in France and Belgium.
   Patients: All consecutive children (excluding neonates) admitted to these PICUs (June 2006 to October 2007) and having acute respiratory failure.
   Intervention: None.
   Measurements and Main Results: We prospectively collected data on variables considered for the Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction-2 score during PICU stay up to eight time points: days 1, 2, 5, 8, 12, 16, and 18, plus PICU discharge. For each variable considered in the Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction-2 score, the most abnormal value observed during time points was collected. Outcome was vital status at PICU discharge. We used areas under receiver operating characteristic curve to estimate the discrimination and Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit tests to estimate calibration of the Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction-2 and the nonrespiratory Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction-2 scores, with correction for the optimism bias using a bootstrap resampling method. We included 1,572 consecutive patients (median age, 20.6 months; interquartile range, 5.5-80.2; mortality rate, 9.5%). Discrimination of the Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction-2 and the nonrespiratory Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction-2 were excellent (areas under receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.93 and 0.92, respectively) and calibration (chi-square test for goodness-of-fit = 5.8, p = 0.45 and 7.6, p = 0.27, respectively) was good. The four nonrespiratory organ dysfunctions were closely related to the risk of mortality (p < 0.001).
   Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that the nonrespiratory Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction-2 score of the entire PICU stay is highly predictive of death in children with acute respiratory failure of whom 94.3% were invasively ventilated. The nonrespiratory Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction-2 score could represent the nonrespiratory organ failure definition tool whose development was recommended in the international expert recommendations on pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome.

AB Although it seems that software metrics have moved beyond mere performance measurement, it is not too clear how machine effectiveness, efficiency, and effort pertain to human requirements on such matters. In industry as well as academia, the ISO 9241-11 norm provides the dominant view on usability, stating that usability is a function of effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. Although intuitively, usability requirements should be part of a software's design in an early stage, conceptually and empirically, it seems more likely that performance requirements (i.e., the absence of errors) should be the center of concern. This paper offers an elaborated view on usability, satisfaction, and performance. Certain theoretical conceptions are tested with data gathered from professional users of banking and hospital systems by means of a 4-year single-item survey and a structured questionnaire, respectively. Results suggested that performance factors (i.e., efficiency) are more important than usability in understanding why stakeholders are satisfied with a system or not. Moreover, it neither is dissatisfaction with a system nor that a system is less usable that predicate requirements change. Instead, avoiding machine inaccuracy best predicted the variability in agreement to "must have" requirements, while achieving human accuracy predicted the variability in agreement to the "won't have" requirements. The present contribution provides a consistent research framework that can bring more focus to design (i.e., prioritization), clarify discussions about design trade-offs, makes concepts measurable, and eventually may lead to better-informed designs.

AB This paper addresses a periodic vehicle routing problem encountered in home health care (HHC) logistics. It extends the classical Periodic Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (PVRPTW) to three types of demands of patients at home. Demands include transportation of drugs/medical devices between the HHC depot and patients' homes, delivery of special drugs from the hospital to patients, and delivery of blood samples from patients to the lab. Each patient requires a certain number of visits within a planning horizon and has a set of possible combinations of visit days. Daily routing should meet time window constraints associated with patients, the hospital and the lab. The problem consists in determining the visit days of each patient and vehicle routes for each day in order to minimize the maximal routing costs among all routes over the horizon. We propose a Tabu Search method combined with different local search schemes including both feasible and infeasible local searches. The proposed approaches are tested on a range of instances derived from existing Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Window (VRPTW) benchmarks and benchmarks on special cases of our problem. Numerical results show that local search scheme starting with an infeasible local search with a small probability followed by a feasible local search with high probability is an interesting hybridization. Experiments with field data from a HHC company show that the proposed approach reduces the total cost and better balances the workloads of vehicles. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study explores gender differences in positive perceptions, anxiety, and depression among mothers and fathers of children with intellectual disabilities (IDs). We examined the relationship between these variables and certain characteristics of both the child (age and severity of disability) and the parents (age, educational level, and employment status). A sample of 60 mother/father couples who had children with IDs completed the Positive Contributions Scale to measure their positive perceptions, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale to assess their level of anxiety and depression. Bivariate analyses were used to determine differences between fathers and mothers as regards their positive perceptions and levels of anxiety and depression. A logistic regression model was then applied to identify which of the variables might be significant predictors of the gender differences observed among parents. Both mothers and fathers had positive perceptions of their children with IDs that co-existed with symptoms of anxiety and depression, with scores being higher among mothers. The predictive analysis of gender showed that individual variables (such as the employment status of both parents) may explain these differences.

AB The use of hierarchical logistic regression for provider profiling has been recommended due to the clustering of patients within hospitals, but has some associated difficulties. We assess changes in hospital outlier status based on standard logistic versus hierarchical logistic modelling of mortality. The study population consisted of all patients admitted to acute, non-specialist hospitals in England between 2007 and 2011 with a primary diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, acute cerebrovascular disease or fracture of neck of femur or a primary procedure of coronary artery bypass graft or repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm. We compared standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) from non-hierarchical models with SMRs from hierarchical models, without and with shrinkage estimates of the predicted probabilities (Model 1 and Model 2). The SMRs from standard logistic and hierarchical models were highly statistically significantly correlated (r>0.91, p=0.01). More outliers were recorded in the standard logistic regression than hierarchical modelling only when using shrinkage estimates (Model 2): 21 hospitals (out of a cumulative number of 565 pairs of hospitals under study) changed from a low outlier and 8 hospitals changed from a high outlier based on the logistic regression to a not-an-outlier based on shrinkage estimates. Both standard logistic and hierarchical modelling have identified nearly the same hospitals as mortality outliers. The choice of methodological approach should, however, also consider whether the modelling aim is judgment or improvement, as shrinkage may be more appropriate for the former than the latter.

ID HEALTH-CARE; MANAGEMENT; REFORM
AB Through a comparative study of six Italian hospitals, the paper develops and tests a framework to analyze hospital-wide patient flow performance.
   The framework adopts a system-wide approach to patient flow management and is structured around three different levels: (1) the hospital, (2) the pipelines (possible patient journeys within the hospital) and (3) the production units (physical spaces, such as operating rooms, where service delivery takes places).
   The focus groups and the data analysis conducted within the study support that the model is a useful tool to investigate hospital-wide implications of patient flows.
   The paper provides also evidence about the causes of hospital patient flow problems. Particularly, while shortage of capacity does not seem to be a relevant driver, our data shows that patient flow variability caused by inadequate allocation of capacity does represent a key problem. Results also show that the lack of coordination between different pipelines and production units is critical, Finally, the problem of overlapping between elective and unscheduled cases can be solved by setting aside a certain level of capacity for unexpected peaks.

AB The European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE) II was developed to improve the overestimation of surgical risk associated with the original (additive and logistic) EuroSCOREs. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the significance of the EuroSCORE II by comparing its performance with that of the original EuroSCOREs in Japanese patients undergoing surgery on the thoracic aorta.
   We have calculated the predicted mortalities according to the additive EuroSCORE, logistic EuroSCORE and EuroSCORE II algorithms in 461 patients who underwent surgery on the thoracic aorta during a period of 20 years (1993-2013).
   The actual in-hospital mortality rates in the low- (additive EuroSCORE of 3-6), moderate- (7-11) and high-risk (>= 11) groups (followed by overall mortality) were 1.3, 6.2 and 14.4% (7.2% overall), respectively. Among the three different risk groups, the expected mortality rates were 5.5 +/- 0.6, 9.1 +/- 0.7 and 13.5 +/- 0.2% (9.5 +/- 0.1% overall) by the additive EuroSCORE algorithm, 5.3 +/- 0.1, 16 +/- 0.4 and 42.4 +/- 1.3% (19.9 +/- 0.7% overall) by the logistic EuroSCORE algorithm and 1.6 +/- 0.1, 5.2 +/- 0.2 and 18.5 +/- 1.3% (7.4 +/- 0.4% overall) by the EuroSCORE II algorithm, indicating poor prediction (P < 0.0001) of the mortality in the high-risk group, especially by the logistic EuroSCORE. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of the additive EuroSCORE, logistic EuroSCORE and EuroSCORE II algorithms were 0.6937, 0.7169 and 0.7697, respectively. Thus, the mortality expected by the EuroSCORE II more closely matched the actual mortality in all three risk groups. In contrast, the mortality expected by the logistic EuroSCORE overestimated the risks in the moderate- (P = 0.0002) and high-risk (P < 0.0001) patient groups.
   Although all of the original EuroSCOREs and EuroSCORE II appreciably predicted the surgical mortality for thoracic aortic surgery in Japanese patients, the EuroSCORE II best predicted the mortalities in all risk groups.

AB The unpredictable nature and devastating impact of earthquakes enforce governments of disaster-prone regions to provide practical response plans to minimize damage and losses resulting from earthquakes. Logistics management is one of the key issues that should be considered for an appropriate response, in particular, the planning of the transport of commodities required during response and the evacuation of injured people. This paper develops a dynamic model for dispatching and routing vehicles in response to an earthquake. We focus on the transport of both commodity towards affected areas and injured people to hospitals. The proposed model is capable of receiving updated information at any time and adjusting plans accordingly. Since speed is a key to a successful earthquake response, the model hierarchically minimizes the total time until arrival at a hospital for injured people, as well as the total lead-time to fulfill commodity needs. We designed experiments to investigate the effect of the network topology on earthquake response rapidity to improve the quality of earthquake response.

TI IMPACT OF A LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT PROGRAM ON ADMITTED PATIENT BOARDERS
   WITHIN AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT
SO JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY NURSING
LA English
DT Article
DE ED boarders; ED holding; Logistics management program
ID INPATIENT LENGTH; STAY; FLOW
AB Introduction: ED crowding is a public health issue, and hospitals across the country must pursue aggressive strategies to improve patient flow to help solve this growing problem. The logistics management program (LMP) is an expansion of the bed management process to include a systematic approach to patient flow management throughout the facility and a clinical liaison or field agent to drive throughput at all points of care. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of an LMP on ED length of stay (ED evaluation times and ED placement times), as well as inpatient length of stay (IPLOS).
   Methods: This is a quasi-experimental study of 28,684 ED admissions in a suburban, tertiary medical center before and after implementing an LMP (2008 vs 2009).
   Results: The median ED evaluation time was 219 minutes (interquartile range [IQR], 178 minutes) in 2008 versus 207 minutes (IQR, 171 minutes) in 2009 (P < .001). The median ED placement time was 219 minutes (IQR, 259 minutes) in 2008 versus 193 minutes (IQR, 158 minutes) in 2009 (P < .001). The median IPLOS was 3.93 days (IQR, 4.9 days) in 2008 versus 3.83 days (IQR, 4.7 days) in 2009 (P < .001), which represents a reduction of 1,483 inpatient days in 2009.
   Discussion: The results provide strong evidence to support the impact of an LMP on decreasing ED evaluation times, ED placement times, and IPLOS. Further exploration is needed to examine the program as a best practice, as well as its applicability for other facilities.

AB Prerecovery liver biopsy (PLB) can potentially to decrease futile recovery and increase utilization of marginal brain-dead donor (BDD) livers. A case-control study was conducted to examine the logistics, safety, histological precision, and liver utilization associated with PLB in BDDs. Twenty-three cases between January 2008 and January 2013 were compared to 2 groups: 48 sequential and 69 clinically matched controls. Compared to the sequential controls, the cases were older (53 versus 46 years), heavier (30.2 versus 25.8 kg/m(2)), had higher prevalences of hypertension (78.3% versus 44.7%) and alcohol use (56.5% versus 23.4%), and a lower United Network for Organ Sharing expected organ yield (0.73 versus 0.81 livers/donor; P<0.05 for all). Baseline characteristics were similar between cases and clinical controls. Donor management time was longer for the cases (22.4 hours) versus sequential controls (16.5 hours, P=0.01) and clinical controls (15.9 hours, P=0.01). Complications for cases (8.7%) were not different from either group of controls (18.8% for sequential controls, P=0.46; 17.4% for clinical controls, P=0.50). The agreement between the donor hospital and study pathologists was substantial regarding evaluation of steatosis (=0.623) and fibrosis (=0.627) and moderate regarding inflammation (=0.495). The proportions of livers that were transplanted were similar for the cases and the clinical controls (60.9% versus 59.4%). In contrast, the proportion of donors for whom liver recovery was not attempted was higher (30.4% versus 8.7%), and the proportion of attempted liver recoveries that did not result in transplantation was lower (8.7% versus 31.9%). These differences were significant at P=0.009. Overall, PLB is logistically feasible with only a minimal delay and is safe, its interpretation at donor hospitals is reproducible, and it appears to decrease futile liver recovery.

AB Within the context of California's public report of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery outcomes, we first thoroughly review popular statistical methods for profiling healthcare providers. Extensive simulation studies are then conducted to compare profiling schemes based on hierarchical logistic regression (LR) modeling under various conditions. Both Bayesian and frequentist's methods are evaluated in classifying hospitals into better', normal' or worse' service providers. The simulation results suggest that no single method would dominate others on all accounts. Traditional schemes based on LR tend to identify too many false outliers, while those based on hierarchical modeling are relatively conservative. The issue of over shrinkage in hierarchical modeling is also investigated using the 2005-2006 California CABG data set. The article provides theoretical and empirical evidence in choosing the right methodology for provider profiling.

AB The fast flow of goods into hospitals is often stalled by the external-internal supply chain interface (i.e. the receipts department). This issue is particularly pertinent regarding the delivery of urgent items for specific patients or in the event of low inventory levels. An unattended electronic locker bank to which individual urgent items can be delivered and subsequently collected by the user' was proposed for Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, UK. The feasibility of this concept is quantified using a hill-climbing model operating with a significant database of consignment movements and qualitatively using staff interviews. Results indicate that a locker bank measuring 4m length, 1.7m height and 0.8m depth, comprising 11 partitions, would be required to accommodate all urgent consignments for any given day. Staff perceptions of the concept were positive suggesting the locker would potentially improve the speed and quality of health care delivered to patients.

AB Objectives: This study aimed to assess the accuracy of the International Ovarian Tumour Analysis (IOTA) logistic regression models (LR1 and LR2) and that of subjective pattern recognition (PR) for the diagnosis of ovarian cancer.
   Methods and Materials: This was a prospective single-center study in a general gynecology unit of a tertiary hospital during 33 months. There were 292 consecutive women who underwent surgery after an ultrasound diagnosis of an adnexal tumor. All examinations were by a single level 2 ultrasound operator, according to the IOTA guidelines. The malignancy likelihood was calculated using the IOTA LR1 and LR2. The women were then examined separately by an expert operator using subjective PR. These were compared to operative findings and histology. The sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve (AUC), and accuracy of the 3 methods were calculated and compared.
   Results: The AUCs for LR1 and LR2 were 0.94 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.92-0.97] and 0.93 (95% CI, 0.90-0.96), respectively. Subjective PR gave a positive likelihood ratio (LR+ve) of 13.9 (95% CI, 7.84-24.6) and a LR-ve of 0.049 (95% CI, 0.022-0.107). The corresponding LR+ve and LR-ve for LR1 were 3.33 (95% CI, 2.85-3.55) and 0.03 (95% CI, 0.01-0.10), and for LR2 were 3.58 (95% CI, 2.77-4.63) and 0.052 (95% CI, 0.022-0.123). The accuracy of PR was 0.942 (95% CI, 0.908-0.966), which was significantly higher when compared with 0.829 (95% CI, 0.781-0.870) for LR1 and 0.836 (95% CI, 0.788-0.872) for LR2 (P < 0.001).
   Conclusions: The AUC of the IOTA LR1 and LR2 were similar in nonexpert's hands when compared to the original and validation IOTA studies. The PR method was the more accurate test to diagnose ovarian cancer than either of the IOTA models.

AB Objective: Foreign body aspiration is a life-threatening emergency for children. Fried chicken is available all over the world, but no cases have previously been reported addressing this food as a tracheobronchial foreign body. We report an extremely rare case of tracheobronchial aspiration of fried chicken complicated by severe bronchitis and postoperative atelectasis. To clarify predisposing factors related to bronchopulmonary complications, we also reviewed paediatric cases of tracheobronchial foreign bodies treated in our department over the past 14 years.
   Methods: We retrospectively reviewed a total of 77 cases of tracheobronchial foreign bodies from 1988 to 2011. The main outcome measure was duration of hospitalisation, reflecting postoperative therapy. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine risk factors for longer hospitalisation.
   Results: Age, sex, and interval between the aspiration episode and bronchoscopy were not significantly associated with longer hospitalisation. Regarding kinds of foreign bodies, higher rates of longer hospitalisation were noted for patients who had aspirated peanut or animal material, as compared to patients who had aspirated non-organic material (odds ratio, 5.80; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-30.43).
   Conclusions: In terms of predicting the risk of pulmonary complications, the type of foreign body aspirated offers a more meaningful factor than the interval between aspiration and operation. Specifically, peanuts or animal material containing oils appear to be associated with a more prolonged pulmonary recovery even after retrieval of the foreign body. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

ID TRAUMA FRACTURE
AB Our fracture liaison service identifies patients with low trauma fractures, determines the need for osteoporosis therapy and instigates therapy if necessary. We describe the tracking and outcome of 768 patients attending our emergency department over 1 year and discuss the problems we encountered and potential solutions.
   Introduction Osteoporotic fractures result in substantial morbidity, mortality and economic cost, and patients sustaining a first fracture are known to be at higher risk of sustaining future fracture. Treatment of at-risk patients has been shown to assist in prevention of future fracture including hip fracture. We established a "First Fracture Project" to identify and treat these patients in 2003.
   Methods We assessed "A Year of Fractures": the logistics, outcome and problems in tracking patients presenting to our emergency department with a low trauma fracture by our fracture liaison service, over 1 year from July 2008 to June 2009. Patients were tracked by our osteoporosis nurse and offered assessment, and treatment where necessary.
   Results In 1 year, 768 patients aged 50 or over were identified from emergency department records as attending with a low trauma fracture. About 84 % of patients eventually received assessment. Of the162 patients progressing through the entire process, 74 % had osteoporosis treatment planned and/or commenced.
   Conclusions Our fracture liaison service was effective at identifying most low trauma fracture patients at risk of further fracture and providing access to osteoporosis assessment. There were many difficulties: we outline logistic and practical issues in delivering our service and suggest potential improvements.

AB Background: Despite the fact that many cancer patients worldwide die in general hospitals, there are few reports of the analysis of delirium in terminally ill cancer patients in this setting. Purpose: This study aimed to identify predictive factors for agitation severity of hyperactive delirium in terminally ill cancer patients in a general hospital. Methods: Participants were 182 consecutively admitted terminally ill cancer patients who died in a Japanese general hospital between April 2009 and March 2011. Variables present one week before death were extracted from the clinical records for regression analysis of factors potentially related to agitation severity of delirium. The prevalence and agitation severity of delirium were evaluated retrospectively. Multivariate ordered logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictive factors. Results: Male sex [odds ratio (OR)=2.125, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.111-4.067; P=0.0227]; total bilirubin (T-bil) [OR=1.557, CI=1.082-2.239; P=0.017]; antibiotics [OR=0.450, CI=0.219-0.925; P=0.0298]; nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [OR=2.608, CI=1.374-4.950; P=0.0034]; and hematological malignancy [OR=3.903, CI=1.363-11.179; P=0.0112] were found to be statistically significant predictors for agitation severity of hyperactive delirium. Conclusions: Our study indicates that male sex, T-bil, antibiotic therapy, NSAID therapy, and hematological malignancy are significant predictors for agitation severity of hyperactive delirium in terminally ill cancer patients in a general hospital setting.

AB Home Health Care (HHC) services are based on a delivery network in which patients are hospitalized at their homes and health care providers must deliver coordinated medical care to patients. Demand for HHC services is rapidly growing and governments and health care providers face the challenge to make a set of complex decisions in a medical service business that has an important component of logistics problems. The objective of this paper is to provide a critical review of models and methods used to support logistics decisions in HHC. For this purpose, a reference framework is proposed first in order to identify research perspectives in the field. Based on this framework, a literature review is presented and research gaps are identified. In particular, the literature review reveals that more emphasizes is needed to develop and implement more integrated methodologies to support decisions at tactical and strategic planning levels and to consider key features from real systems.

AB Background Although high-risk left main PCI populations have been previously described, there is little data describing outcomes and the role of the logistic EuroSCORE in surgical turndown cohorts or patients in extremis due to acute infarction or cardiogenic shock from left main ischemia.
   Methods Consecutive patients with unprotected LM PCI who were surgical turndowns or in extremis were included in this retrospective cohort from 2004 to 2009 at two tertiary centers. Predictors of in-hospital mortality were identified utilizing routine and stepwise logistic regression.
   Results There were a total of 56 patients with mean age of 69 (+/- 13). There were 23 (41%) patients with cardiogenic shock. The mean logistic EuroSCORE was 23.5%+/- 21%. In-hospital death occurred in 12 (21%) patients, largely restricted to the shock subgroup (11/12). Univariate predictors of mortality included peak CK levels (P=0.01), transfusion (P=0.01), cardiogenic shock (P<0.002), male gender (P=0.027), and logistic EuroSCORE (P=0.01). Stepwise logistic regression yielded logistic EuroSCORE (P=0.04, OR: 1.25 (95% CI: 1.01-1.56) for every 5% increase) and peak CK level (P=0.001, OR: 1.23 (95% CI: 1.09-1.40) for every 500 unit increase) as independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. The AUC ROC for logistic EuroSCORE was 0.73; and for logistic EuroSCORE plus peak CK level was 0.89.
   Conclusion PCI appears to be a reasonable option in the high risk no option LM population, with the logistic EuroSCORE and peak CK levels being independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. Specifically, the logistic EuroSCORE and peak CK level combined discriminate in-hospital mortality with a high degree of certainty. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB In this study, we sought to analyse the incidence of major non-cardiac complications and their impact on survival following cardiac surgery procedures in a contemporary patient cohort. We further determined independent predictors of perioperative mortality and created a logistic regression model for prediction of outcome after the occurrence of these complications.
   Prospectively collected data of 5318 consecutive adult patients (mean age 68.9 +/- 11.0 years; 29.3% [n = 1559] female) undergoing cardiac surgery from January 2009 to May 2012 were retrospectively analysed. Outcome measures were six major non-cardiac complications including respiratory failure, dialysis-dependent renal failure, deep sternal wound infection (DSWI), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), gastrointestinal complications (GIC) and sepsis and their impact on perioperative mortality and hospital length of stay using multivariate regression models. The discriminatory power was evaluated by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (C statistic).
   A total of 1321 complications were observed in 846 (15.9%) patients: respiratory failure (n = 432; 8.1%), dialysis-dependent renal failure (n = 295; 5.5%), GIC (n = 154; 2.9%), CVA (n = 151; 2.8%), DSWI (n = 146; 2.7%) and sepsis (n = 143; 2.7%). Perioperative mortality was 17.0% in patients with at least one major non-cardiac complication and correlated with the number of complications (single, 9.7%; n = 53/549; double, 24.0%; n = 44/183; >= 3, 41.2%; n = 47/114, P < 0.001). Six preoperative and four postoperative independent predictors of operative mortality were identified (age (odds ratio [OR] 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3-2.4), peripheral vascular disease (OR 2.6; 95% CI 1.6-4.2), pulmonary hypertension (OR 2.7; 95% CI 1.5-4.9), atrial fibrillation (OR 1.5; 95% CI 1.0-2.3), emergency (OR 5.0; 95% CI 3.4-7.2), other procedures than CABG (OR 1.5; 95% CI 1.0-2.1), postoperative dialysis (OR 4.0; 95% CI 2.6-6.1), sepsis (OR 3.4; 95% CI 2.0-5.6), respiratory failure (OR 3.2; 95% CI 2.2-4.9), GIC (OR 3.2; 95% CI 1.9-5.3)) and included in the logistic model, which accurately predicted outcome (C statistic, 0.892; 95% CI 0.868-0.916). Length of hospital stay was significantly increased according to the number of complications (single: median 15 (IQR 10-24) days, double: 16 (IQR 8-28) days, >= 3: 20 (IQR 13-39) days, P < 0.001).
   With a worsening in the risk profile of patients undergoing cardiac surgery, an increasing number of patients develop major complications leading to increased length of stay and mortality, which is correlated to the number and severity of these complications. Our predictive model based on preoperative and postoperative variables allowed us to determine with accuracy the perioperative mortality in critically ill patients after cardiac surgery.

AB As many as 14 % of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery are readmitted within 30 days. Readmission is usually the result of morbidity and may lead to death. The purpose of this study is to develop and compare statistical and genetic programming models to predict readmission. Patients were divided into separate Construction and Validation populations. Using 88 variables, logistic regression, genetic programs, and artificial neural nets were used to develop predictive models. Models were first constructed and tested on the Construction populations, then validated on the Validation population. Areas under the receiver operator characteristic curves (AU ROC) were used to compare the models. Two hundred and two patients (7.6 %) in the 2,644 patient Construction group and 216 (8.0 %) of the 2,711 patient Validation group were re-admitted within 30 days of CABG surgery. Logistic regression predicted readmission with AU ROC = .675 +/- A .021 in the Construction group. Genetic programs significantly improved the accuracy, AU ROC = .767 +/- A .001, p < .001). Artificial neural nets were less accurate with AU ROC = 0.597 +/- A .001 in the Construction group. Predictive accuracy of all three techniques fell in the Validation group. However, the accuracy of genetic programming (AU ROC = .654 +/- A .001) was still trivially but statistically non-significantly better than that of the logistic regression (AU ROC = .644 +/- A .020, p = .61). Genetic programming and logistic regression provide alternative methods to predict readmission that are similarly accurate.

AB Objective: To assess the congenital and postnatal factors that affect degree of malocclusion in patients with unilateral cleft lip and palate using multivariate statistical analysis.
   Design: Retrospective study.
   Patients: All information on 135 subjects with unilateral cleft lip and palate was obtained from an oral examination and radiograph at the initial examination at an orthodontic clinic and from surgical records. Plaster models were taken before orthodontic treatment. The ages of the subjects ranged from 5 to 8 years with a mean age of 6.9 years. All primary surgeries for the patients were performed at a university hospital.
   Main Outcome Measures: The GOSLON Yardstick was used to assess the dental arch relationships (degree of malocclusion) in patients. Family history of Class III, degree of cleft, and congenitally missing upper lateral incisor on the cleft side were chosen as congenital factors inducing malocclusion. Presurgical orthopedic treatment, cheiloplasty, and palatoplasty were chosen as postnatal factors. Associations between various factors and dental arch relationships were assessed using logistic regression analysis.
   Results: According to adjusted odds ratios, family history of Class III is associated with a significantly worse dental arch relationship. Palatoplasty using push-back alone correlated to a dental arch relationship that was significantly worse than palatoplasty using push-back with a buccal flap.
   Conclusions: Multivariate analysis shows evidence that a positive family history of Class III and palatoplasty using push-back alone are associated with worse malocclusion of unilateral cleft lip and palate patients.

AB Background: This study aims to identify high-risk patient groups for bleeding after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.
   Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 205 patients (143 males, 62 females; mean age 59.7 +/- 10.1 years; range, 28 to 83 years) undergoing CABG surgery between June 2001 and August 2008 at Jamaran Heart Hospital, Tehran, Iran. Baseline characteristics of the patients and postoperative bleeding status were recorded. For classifying the bleeders and non-bleeders, classic logistic regression and decision tree models were utilized.
   Results: Logistic regression analysis showed that sex was significantly related to postoperative bleeding. Decision tree model revealed that age (score=100), diabetes mellitus (score=16.38), sex (score=13.67), capital residency (score=7.31) and dyslipidemia (score=5.06) were found to have an impact on bleeding. We also observed that the decision tree model provided a better classification of the patients than logistic regression.
   Conclusion: Surgeons should be aware of risk indicators of bleeding such as older age, male sex, absence of diabetes mellitus and presence of dyslipidemia in patients with three bypassed vessels before CABG. We also recommend statisticians to utilize the decision tree model instead of logistic regression analysis in classification of risk groups.

AB Objective:
   Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome is the main cause of death in adult ICUs and in PICUs. The PEdiatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction score developed in 1999 was primarily designed to describe the severity of organ dysfunction. This study was undertaken to update and improve the PEdiatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction score, using a larger and more recent dataset.
   Design:
   Prospective multicenter cohort study.
   Setting:
   Nine multidisciplinary, tertiary-care PICUs of university-affiliated hospitals in France and Belgium.
   Patients:
   All consecutive children admitted to these PICUs (June 2006-October 2007).
   Intervention:
   None.
   Measurements and Main Results:
   We collected data on variables considered for the PEdiatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction-2 score during PICU stay up to eight time points: days 1, 2, 5, 8, 12, 16, and 18, plus PICU discharge. For each variable considered for the PEdiatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction-2 score, the most abnormal value observed during time points was collected. The outcome was vital status at PICU discharge. Identification of the best variable cutoffs was performed using bivariate analyses. The PEdiatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction-2 score was developed by multivariable logistic regressions and bootstrap process. We used areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curve to evaluate discrimination and Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit tests to evaluate calibration. We enrolled 3,671 consecutive patients (median age, 15.5 mo; interquartile range, 2.2-70.7). Mortality rate was 6.0% (222 deaths). The PEdiatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction-2 score includes ten variables corresponding to five organ dysfunctions. Discrimination (areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curve = 0.934) and calibration (chi-square test for goodness-of-fit = 9.31, p = 0.317) of the PEdiatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction-2 score were good.
   Conclusion:
   We developed and validated the PEdiatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction-2 score, which allows assessment of the severity of cases of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome in the PICU with a continuous scale. The PEdiatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction-2 score now includes mean arterial pressure and lactatemia in the cardiovascular dysfunction and does not include hepatic dysfunction. The score will be in the public domain, which means that it can be freely used in clinical trials.

AB The ELSA (Estudo Longitudinal de Sa de do Adulto - Brazilian Longitudinal Study for Adult Health) is a multicenter cohort study which aims at the identification of risk factors associated with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases in the Brazilian population. The paper describes the strategies for the collection, processing, transportation, and quality control of blood and urine tests in the ELSA. The study decided to centralize the tests at one single laboratory. The processing of the samples was performed at the local laboratories, reducing the weight of the material to be transported, and diminishing the costs of transportation to the central laboratory at the Universidade de Sao Paulo Hospital. The study included tests for the evaluation of diabetes, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, electrolyte abnormalities, thyroid hormones, uric acid, hepatic enzyme abnormalities, inflammation, and total blood cell count. In addition, leukocyte DNA, urine, plasma and serum samples were stored. The central laboratory performed approximately 375,000 tests.

AB Objectives: To outline the uses of logistic regression and other statistical methods for risk factor analysis in the context of research on stuttering.
   Design: The principles underlying the application of a logistic regression are illustrated, and the types of questions to which such a technique has been applied in the stuttering field are outlined. The assumptions and limitations of the technique are discussed with respect to existing stuttering research, and with respect to formulating appropriate research strategies to accommodate these considerations. Finally, some alternatives to the approach are briefly discussed.
   Results: The way the statistical procedures are employed are demonstrated with some hypothetical data.
   Conclusion: Research into several practical issues concerning stuttering could benefit if risk factor modelling were used. Important examples are early diagnosis, prognosis (whether a child will recover or persist) and assessment of treatment outcome.
   Educational objectives: After reading this article you will: (a) Summarize the situations in which logistic regression can be applied to a range of issues about stuttering; (b) Follow the steps in performing a logistic regression analysis; (c) Describe the assumptions of the logistic regression technique and the precautions that need to be checked when it is employed; (d) Be able to summarize its advantages over other techniques like estimation of group differences and simple regression.

AB Using simulation as an approach to display and improve internal logistics at hospitals has great potential. This study shows how a simulation model displaying the morning blood-taking round at a Danish public hospital can be developed and utilized with the aim of improving the logistics. The focus of the simulation was to evaluate changes made to the transportation of blood samples between wards and the laboratory. The average-(AWT) and maximum waiting time (MWT) from a blood sample was drawn at the ward until it was received at the laboratory, and the distribution of arrivals of blood samples in the laboratory were used as the evaluation criteria. Four different scenarios were tested and compared with the current approach: (1) Using AGVs (mobile robots), (2) using a pneumatic tube system, (3) using porters that are called upon, or (4) using porters that come to the wards every 45 minutes. Furthermore, each of the scenarios was tested in terms of what amount of resources would give the optimal result. The simulations showed a big improvement potential in implementing a new technology/mean for transporting the blood samples. The pneumatic tube system showed the biggest potential lowering the AWT and MWT with approx. 36% and 18%, respectively. Additionally, all of the scenarios had a more even distribution of arrivals except for porters coming to the wards every 45 min. As a consequence of the results obtained in the study, the hospital decided to implement a pneumatic tube system.

TI Dynamic trends in cardiac surgery: why the logistic EuroSCORE is no
   longer suitable for contemporary cardiac surgery and implications for
   future risk models

AB Progressive loss of calibration of the original EuroSCORE models has necessitated the introduction of the EuroSCORE II model. Poor model calibration has important implications for clinical decision-making and risk adjustment of governance analyses. The objective of this study was to explore the reasons for the calibration drift of the logistic EuroSCORE.
   Data from the Society for Cardiothoracic Surgery in Great Britain and Ireland database were analysed for procedures performed at all National Health Service and some private hospitals in England and Wales between April 2001 and March 2011. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. EuroSCORE risk factors, overall model calibration and discrimination were assessed over time.
   A total of 317 292 procedures were included. Over the study period, mean age at surgery increased from 64.6 to 67.2 years. The proportion of procedures that were isolated coronary artery bypass grafts decreased from 67.5 to 51.2%. In-hospital mortality fell from 4.1 to 2.8%, but the mean logistic EuroSCORE increased from 5.6 to 7.6%. The logistic EuroSCORE remained a good discriminant throughout the study period (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve between 0.79 and 0.85), but calibration (observed-to-expected mortality ratio) fell from 0.76 to 0.37. Inadequate adjustment for decreasing baseline risk affected calibration considerably.
   Patient risk factors and case-mix in adult cardiac surgery change dynamically over time. Models like the EuroSCORE that are developed using a 'snapshot' of data in time do not account for this and can subsequently lose calibration. It is therefore important to regularly revalidate clinical prediction models.

AB Objectives In a review based on estimations and assumptions, to report the estimated number of survivors after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in whom cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was started and to speculate about possible future improvements in Sweden. Design An observational study. Setting All ambulance organisations in Sweden. Subjects Patients included in the Swedish Cardiac Arrest Registry who suffered an OHCA between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2010. Approximately 80% of OHCA cases in Sweden in which CPR was started are included. Interventions None Results In 11005 patients, the 1-month survival rate was 9.4%. There are approximately 5000 OHCA cases annually in which CPR is started and 30-day survival is achieved in up to 500 patients yearly (6 per 100000 inhabitants). Based on findings on survival in relation to the time to calling for the Emergency Medical Service (EMS) and the start of CPR and defibrillation, it was estimated that, if the delay from collapse to (i) calling EMS, (ii) the start of CPR, and (iii) the time to defibrillation were reduced to <2min, <2min, and <8min, respectively, 300400 additional lives could be saved. Conclusion Based on findings relating to the delay to calling for the EMS and the start of CPR and defibrillation, we speculate that 300400 additional OHCA patients yearly (4 per 100000 inhabitants) could be saved in Sweden.

AB Background. There is still a wide debate concerning the performance of commonly used risk prediction models in assessing the risk of patients undergoing isolated aortic valve surgery. This study was designed to compare the performances of European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE) II and age, creatinine, and ejection fraction (ACEF) score with those of The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) score and logistic EuroSCORE in patients undergoing isolated aortic valve surgery.
   Methods. Data on 1,758 consecutive patients who underwent isolated aortic valve replacement in a 6-year period were retrieved from 3 prospective institutional databases. Discriminatory power was assessed using the c-index. Calibration was evaluated with calibration curves and associated statistics.
   Results. In-hospital mortality rate was 1.4%. The discriminatory power was similar in all algorithms (area under the curve 0.80, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72 to 0.88 for logistic EuroSCORE; 0.81, 95% CI 0.73 to -0.88 for EuroSCORE II; 0.78, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.88 for ACEF; 0.85, 95% CI 0.78-0.93 for STS score) and not significantly different (p values > 0.05 for all tests). The EuroSCORE II had a better calibration, being the only score with nonsignificant associated statistics (unreliability test, Hosmer-Lemeshow test, and Spiegelhalter Z-test for calibration accuracy). Nonetheless, EuroSCORE II calibration plot highlighted a trend over under-prediction.
   Conclusions. The EuroSCORE II is a good predictor of perioperative mortality in isolated aortic valve surgery, with lower discrimination if compared with STS and a better calibration when compared with logistic EuroSCORE, ACEF, and STS scores. Its performance is optimal in the lowest tertile of patients, whereas it under-predicts mortality afterward. None of these algorithms seems suitable for risk estimation in mid and high-risk patients that are the ones who might benefit most from transcatheter procedures.

AB Object. Most reports compare artificial neural network (ANN) models and logistic regression models in only a single data set, and the essential issue of internal validity (reproducibility) of the models has not been adequately addressed. This study proposes to validate the use of the ANN model for predicting in-hospital mortality after traumatic brain injury (TBI) surgery and to compare the predictive accuracy of ANN with that of the logistic regression model.
   Methods. The authors of this study retrospectively analyzed 16,956 patients with TBI nationwide who were surgically treated in Taiwan between 1998 and 2009. For every 1000 pairs of ANN and logistic regression models, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), Hosmer-Lemeshow statistics, and accuracy rate were calculated and compared using paired t-tests. A global sensitivity analysis was also performed to assess the relative importance of input parameters in the ANN model and to rank the variables in order of importance.
   Results. The ANN model outperformed the logistic regression model in terms of accuracy in 95.15% of cases, in terms of Hosmer-Lemeshow statistics in 43.68% of cases, and in terms of the AUC in 89.14% of cases. The global sensitivity analysis of in-hospital mortality also showed that the most influential (sensitive) parameters in the ANN model were surgeon volume followed by hospital volume, Charlson comorbidity index score, length of stay, sex, and age.
   Conclusions. This work supports the continued use of ANNs for predictive modeling of neurosurgery outcomes. However, further studies are needed to confirm the clinical efficacy of the proposed model. (http://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2013.1.JNS121130)

AB The change in c-statistic is frequently used to summarize the change in predictive accuracy when a novel risk factor is added to an existing logistic regression model. We explored the relationship between the absolute change in the c-statistic, Brier score, generalized R2, and the discrimination slope when a risk factor was added to an existing model in an extensive set of Monte Carlo simulations. The increase in model accuracy due to the inclusion of a novel marker was proportional to both the prevalence of the marker and to the odds ratio relating the marker to the outcome but inversely proportional to the accuracy of the logistic regression model with the marker omitted. We observed greater improvements in model accuracy when the novel risk factor or marker was uncorrelated with the existing predictor variable compared with when the risk factor has a positive correlation with the existing predictor variable. We illustrated these findings by using a study on mortality prediction in patients hospitalized with heart failure. In conclusion, the increase in predictive accuracy by adding a marker should be considered in the context of the accuracy of the initial model. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The recent guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommend the creation of regional networks for the optimal management of patients with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).
   The primary aim of these networks should be to achieve a high rate of primary percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) within the recommended time intervals.
   Therefore, an excellent and trusted collaboration between primary care physicians, ambulance systems, non-PCI hospitals, and 24-h PCI hospitals is necessary. This manuscript summarizes the most recent recommendations of the ESC-STEMI guidelines and describes their consequences for clinical practice and the implementation of networks.

AB The goal of this study was to analyze a 54-item instrument for assessment of perception of exposure to environmental contaminants within the context of the built environment, or exposome. This exposome was defined in five domains to include 1) home and hobby, 2) school, 3) community, 4) occupation, and 5) exposure history. Interviews were conducted with child-bearing-age minority women at Metro Nashville General Hospital at Meharry Medical College. Data were analyzed utilizing DTReg software for Support Vector Machine (SVM) modeling followed by an SPSS package for a logistic regression model. The target (outcome) variable of interest was respondent's residence by ZIP code. The results demonstrate that the rank order of important variables with respect to SVM modeling versus traditional logistic regression models is almost identical. This is the first study documenting that SVM analysis has discriminate power for determination of higher-ordered spatial relationships on an environmental exposure history questionnaire.

AB Background The SYNTAX score (SXscore), an anatomical-based scoring tool reflecting the complexity of coronary anatomy, has established itself as an important long-term prognostic factor in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The incorporation of clinical factors may further augment the utility of the SXscore to longer-term risk stratify the individual patient for clinical outcomes.
   Methods and results Patient-level merged data from >6000 patients in seven contemporary coronary stent trials was used to develop a logistic regression model-the Logistic Clinical SXscore-to predict 1-year risk for all-cause death and major adverse cardiac events (MACE). A core model (composed of the SXscore, age, creatinine clearance, and left ventricular ejection fraction) and an extended model [incorporating the core model and six additional (best performing) clinical variables] were developed and validated in a cross-validation procedure. The core model demonstrated a substantial improvement in predictive ability for 1-year all-cause death compared with the SXscore in isolation [area under the receiver operator curve (AUC): core model: 0.753, SXscore: 0.660]. A minor incremental benefit of the extended model was shown (AUC: 0.791). Consequently the core model alone was retained in the final the Logistic Clinical SXscore model. Validation plots confirmed the model predictions to be well calibrated. For 1-year MACE, the addition of clinical variables did not improve the predictive ability of the SXscore, secondary to the SXscore being the predominant determinant of all-cause revascularization.
   Conclusion The Logistic Clinical SXscore substantially enhances the prediction of 1-year mortality after PCI compared with the SXscore, and allows for an accurate personalized assessment of patient risk.

ID STATISTICS NOTES; TRENDS
AB Aim. To illustrate the use of regression and logistic regression models to investigate changes over time in size of babies particularly in relation to social deprivation, age of the mother and smoking. Background. Mean birthweight has been found to be increasing in many countries in recent years, but there are still a group of babies who are born with low birthweights. Design. Population-based retrospective cohort study. Method. Multiple linear regression and logistic regression models are used to analyse data on term singleton births from Scottish hospitals between 19942003. Results. Mothers who smoke are shown to give birth to lighter babies on average, a difference of approximately 0.57 Standard deviations lower (95% confidence interval. 0.550.58) when adjusted for sex and parity. These mothers are also more likely to have babies that are low birthweight (odds ratio 3.46, 95% confidence interval 3.303.63) compared with non-smokers. Low birthweight is 30% more likely where the mother lives in the most deprived areas compared with the least deprived, (odds ratio 1.30, 95% confidence interval 1.211.40). Conclusions. Smoking during pregnancy is shown to have a detrimental effect on the size of infants at birth. This effect explains some, though not all, of the observed socioeconomic birthweight. It also explains much of the observed birthweight differences by the age of the mother. Relevance to clinical practice. Identifying mothers at greater risk of having a low birthweight baby as important implications for the care and advice this group receives.

AB The term Civil Military Co-ordination (CIMIC) suggests the seamless division of labour between aid workers and international military forces. The images of humanitarian organisations distributing food and medicines under the protection of military forces, or aid workers and military working together to construct refugee camps, set up field hospitals, provide emergency water and sanitation, has become more frequent. The media coverage from natural and man-made disasters in recent years, has heightened the expectation of a smooth interaction between humanitarian organisations and military forces. Due to fundamental differences between international military forces, humanitarian and development organisations (in terms of the principles and doctrines guiding their work, their agendas, operating styles, and roles), the area of civil military coordination in disaster relief has proven to be more difficult than other interagency relationships. In order to address this, the authors outline the usage of systems analysis and design technique (SADT) to explain how a more effective coordination of humanitarian operations by military and civilian organisations involved in disaster relief can be achieved across the range of humanitarian aid lifecycle phases. Furthermore the authors provide an empirical comparison of military and humanitarian organisation partnership evaluation criteria for (CIMIC). Finally, the authors then develop and present how the SADT approach can inform the development of a systems dynamics model using systems archetypes (SA) to describe the rich interactions between stakeholders and involved components. The authors propose a framework which identifies these facets as a result. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: To identify predictive factors for the occurrence of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN).
   Methods: The participants were 73 herpes zoster patients who had been treated at the pain clinic of our hospital between January 2008 and June 2010. Variables present at the initial visit were extracted from the clinical records for regression analysis of factors related to the occurrence of PHN. The following scores for response were used: 0 = no PHN after 3 months; 1 = PHN present after 3 months but absent after 6 months; and 2 = PHN present after 6 months. Multivariate ordered logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the predictive factors for PHN.
   Results: Advanced age [odds ratio (OR) = 2.740, confidence interval (CI) = 1.110-6.761; P = 0.0288] and deep pain (OR = 4.244, CI = 1.114-16.163; P = 0.0341) at the initial visit to our outpatient pain clinic were found to be significant predictive factors for the occurrence of PHN. Diabetes mellitus (OR = 3.075) and pain reduced by bathing (OR = 3.389) also had high OR, although they were not significant.
   Discussion: Our study indicates that advanced age and deep pain at the initial visit are significant predictors for PHN. Our results are considered likely to contribute to the establishment of evidencebased medicine in the optimal treatment of PHN.

AB Objective To determine whether variables in physicians' backgrounds influenced their decision to forego resuscitating a patient they did not previously know.
   Methods Questionnaire survey of a convenience sample of 204 physicians working in the departments of internal medicine, anaesthesiology and cardiology in 11 hospitals in Israel.
   Results Twenty per cent of the participants had elected to forego resuscitating a patient they did not previously know without additional consultation. Physicians who had more frequently elected to forego resuscitation had practised medicine for more than 5 years (p=0.013), estimated the number of resuscitations they had performed as being higher (p=0.009), and perceived their experience in resuscitation as sufficient (p=0.001). The variable that predicted the outcome of always performing resuscitation in the logistic regression model was less than 5 years of experience in medicine (OR 0.227, 95% CI 0.065 to 0.793; p=0.02).
   Conclusion Physicians' level of experience may affect the probability of a patient's receiving resuscitation, whereas the physicians' personal beliefs and values did not seem to affect this outcome.

AB Background: Research showed that promising approaches such as benchmarking, operations research, lean management and six sigma, could be adopted to improve patient logistics in healthcare. To our knowledge, little research has been conducted to obtain an overview on the use, combination and effects of approaches to improve patient logistics in hospitals. We therefore examined the approaches and tools used to improve patient logistics in Dutch hospitals, the reported effects of these approaches on performance, the applied support structure and the methods used to evaluate the effects.
   Methods: A survey among experts on patient logistics in 94 Dutch hospitals. The survey data were analysed using cross tables.
   Results: Forty-eight percent of all hospitals participated. Ninety-eight percent reported to have used multiple approaches, 39% of them used five or more approaches. Care pathways were the preferred approach by 43% of the hospitals, followed by business process re-engineering and lean six sigma (both 13%). Flowcharts were the most commonly used tool, they were used on a regular basis by 94% of the hospitals. Less than 10% of the hospitals used data envelopment analysis and critical path analysis on a regular basis. Most hospitals (68%) relied on external support for process analyses and education on patient logistics, only 24% had permanent internal training programs on patient logistics. Approximately 50% of the hospitals that evaluated the effects of approaches on efficiency, throughput times and financial results, reported that they had accomplished their goals. Goal accomplishment in general hospitals ranged from 63% to 67%, in academic teaching hospitals from 0% to 50%, and in teaching hospitals from 25% to 44%. More than 86% performed an evaluation, 53% performed a post-intervention measurement.
   Conclusions: Patient logistics appeared to be a rather new subject as most hospitals had not selected a single approach, they relied on external support and they did not have permanent training programs. Hospitals used a combination of approaches and tools, about half of the hospitals reported goal accomplishment and no approach seemed to outperform the others. To make improvement efforts more successful, research should be conducted into the selection and application of approaches, their contingency factors, and goal-setting procedures.

AB Background Acute-on-chronic hepatitis B liver failure (ACLF-HBV) is a clinically severe disease associated with major life-threatening complications including hepatic encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome. The aim of this study was to evaluate the short-term prognostic predictability of the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD), MELD-based indices, and their dynamic changes in patients with ACLF-HBV, and to establish a new model for predicting the prognosis of ACLF-HBV.
   Methods A total of 172 patients with ACLF-HBV who stayed in the hospital for more than 2 weeks were retrospectively recruited. The predictive accuracy of MELD, MELD-based indices, and their dynamic change (A) were compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve method. The associations between mortality and patient characteristics were studied by univariate and multivariate analyses.
   Results The 3-month mortality was 43.6%. The largest concordance (c) statistic predicting 3-month mortality was the MELD score at the end of 2 weeks of admission (0.8), followed by the MELD:sodium ratio (MESO) (0.796) and integrated MELD (iMELD) (0.758) scores, AMELD (0.752), AMESO (0.729), and MELD plus sodium (MELD-Na) (0.728) scores. In multivariate Logistic regression analysis, the independent factors predicting prognosis were hepatic encephalopathy (OR=3.466), serum creatinine, international normalized ratio (INR), and total bilirubin at the end of 2 weeks of admission (OR=10.302, 6.063, 5.208, respectively), and cholinesterase on admission (OR=0.255). This regression model had a greater prognostic value (c=0.85, 95% Cl 0.791-0.909) compared to the MELD score at the end of 2 weeks of admission (Z=4.9851, P=0.0256).
   Conclusions MELD score at the end of 2 weeks of admission is a useful predictor for 3-month mortality in ACLF-HBV patients. Hepatic encephalopathy, serum creatinine, international normalized ratio, and total bilirubin at the end of 2 weeks of admission and cholinesterase on admission are independent predictors of 3-month mortality.

AB Mortality from breast cancer is decreasing partly owing to early detection. In Mersin province in our country, local health authorities launched an education program on sexual diseases and breast cancer early detection for women over 15 years of age. After the educational session, clinical breast examination was offered by a nurse or physician, and if suspicious they were recommended to apply a specialist for further examination. Here, we report the results on those women with abnormal clinical breast examination. In this second project, socio-demographic variables were investigated such as educational level and place of living, parameters to measure the success of previous project, whether they followed the recommendation themselves, whether mammograms were reported in accordance with Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BIRADS). Of 3,793 women recruited, mean age was 42.2 years, 42.3% were younger than 40.0 years. Majority (88.5%) were married, graduate of primary school (60.6%), without a job (91.2%), and inhabiting in the province (38.7%). Of the population, 98.1% believe in the importance of screening in the treatment of breast cancer. According to 70.3%, monthly breast self-examination enables early detection, 33.5% believe that clinical breast examination detects cancer early, and 35.5% think that annual mammography can detect it early. Among 2,183 women 40 years of age or over, 41.5% had mammography at once before participating in the first project. Breast self-examination was being carried out by 56.6% on a monthly basis. After an abnormal breast examination, 86.4% applied to hospitals for specialist examination. Reasons for declining to seek for further examination among 410 women answering were as follows: 42.0% did not accept, 27.0% did not know it was important, 16.6% because of economical reasons, and 5.0% were too shy to be examined. Being older, being married, being the graduate of primary and secondary school, residing in rural areas, having a mammogram positively affected the decision in univariate analyses ( < 0.05). All but educational level ( = 0.059) remained significant in multivariate analysis. Mammography was reported in accordance with BIRADS in only 45 (1.2%). Awareness of population on breast cancer early detection can be raised through education. Generally, women follow professional recommendation from professionals. Mammography reporting among radiologist in accordance with BIRADS is rare. Successful early detection of breast cancer may be obtained by public education together with improving detection methods.

SO JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE MANAGEMENT

DT Article
ID RURAL HOSPITALS
AB From 1980 to 1999, rural designated hospitals closed at a disproportionally high rate. In response to this emergent threat to healthcare access in rural settings, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 made provisions for the creation of a new rural hospital-the critical access hospital (CAH). The conversion to CAH and the associated cost-based reimbursement scheme significantly slowed the closure rate of rural hospitals. This work investigates which methods can ensure the long-term viability of small hospitals.
   This article uses a two-step design to focus on a hypothesized relationship between technical efficiency of CAHs and a recently developed set of financial monitors for these entities. The goal is to identify the financial performance measures associated with efficiency. The first step uses data envelopment analysis (DEA) to differentiate efficient from inefficient facilities within a data set of 183 CAHs. Determining DEA efficiency is an a priori categorization of hospitals in the data set as efficient or inefficient. In the second step, DEA efficiency is the categorical dependent variable (efficient = 0, inefficient = 1) in the subsequent binary logistic regression (LR) model. A set of six financial monitors selected from the array of 20 measures were the LR independent variables. We use a binary LR to test the null hypothesis that recently developed CAH financial indicators had no predictive value for categorizing a CAH as efficient or inefficient, (i.e., there is no relationship between DEA efficiency and fiscal performance).

TI Comparison of Artificial Neural Network and Logistic Regression Models
   for Predicting In-Hospital Mortality after Primary Liver Cancer Surgery

ID HEPATOCELLULAR-CARCINOMA; GENETIC ALGORITHM; TRANSPLANTATION; RISK
AB Background: Since most published articles comparing the performance of artificial neural network (ANN) models and logistic regression (LR) models for predicting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) outcomes used only a single dataset, the essential issue of internal validity (reproducibility) of the models has not been addressed. The study purposes to validate the use of ANN model for predicting in-hospital mortality in HCC surgery patients in Taiwan and to compare the predictive accuracy of ANN with that of LR model.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Patients who underwent a HCC surgery during the period from 1998 to 2009 were included in the study. This study retrospectively compared 1,000 pairs of LR and ANN models based on initial clinical data for 22,926 HCC surgery patients. For each pair of ANN and LR models, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves, Hosmer-Lemeshow (H-L) statistics and accuracy rate were calculated and compared using paired T-tests. A global sensitivity analysis was also performed to assess the relative significance of input parameters in the system model and the relative importance of variables. Compared to the LR models, the ANN models had a better accuracy rate in 97.28% of cases, a better H-L statistic in 41.18% of cases, and a better AUROC curve in 84.67% of cases. Surgeon volume was the most influential (sensitive) parameter affecting in-hospital mortality followed by age and lengths of stay.
   Conclusions/Significance: In comparison with the conventional LR model, the ANN model in the study was more accurate in predicting in-hospital mortality and had higher overall performance indices. Further studies of this model may consider the effect of a more detailed database that includes complications and clinical examination findings as well as more detailed outcome data.

AB Objectives To explore the causes and risk factors of inpatient death for patients with warfare-related limb trauma.
   Methods A retrospective study involving 339 patients with warfare-related limb trauma who were admitted to our hospital from 1998 to 2002 was conducted. Autopsy was performed for 15 cases who died in order to investigate the cause of death. Furthermore, based on the clinical features of warfare-related trauma patients, 11 factors were selected for further analysis: X1: causes of trauma, X2: shock after injury, X3: time from injury to hospital admission, X4: injured sites, X5: combined trauma (including head, thorax, abdomen, and vascular injury), X6: number of surgical procedures, X7: foreign body remaining, X8: fracture, X9: amputation, X10: duration of tourniquet homeostasis, X11: infection. All variables were available in all cases, and all parameters were quantified and fed into a computer. Multivariate statistical analysis was performed with a logistic regression model to elucidate the risk factors influencing death.
   Results Fifteen of the 339 inpatient cases died (4.4%). The causes were primarily acute renal failure (ARF) (seven cases, 46.7%), pulmonary embolism (PE) (three cases, 20.0%), multiple organ system failure (MOSF) (two cases, 13.3%), and gas gangrene (three cases, 20.0%). There was one case of gas gangrene with concomitant ARF, and one of gas gangrene with MOSF. The primary risk factors influencing death included shock, amputation, and complicating infection (P < 0.05).
   Conclusion The primary cause of death from warfare-related limb trauma is ARF. The appropriate and prompt management of shock patients, the correct timing of amputation, and the prevention and correct handling of infection are important in reducing mortality.

AB Objective: We describe the short-term results of the patients who underwent transapical treatment of a paravalvular leak (PVL) in our centre. Background: Increasing experience with transapical aortic valve implantation has inspired us to explore this approach for prosthetic paravalvular leak reduction in high risk patients. Methods: All procedures were performed in the catheterization laboratory under general anesthesia, using a small anterolateral thoracotomy to expose the apex. Access through a 9-French sheath was necessary to introduce the Amplatzer Vascular III plug. Three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography (3D-TEE) was used to guide the operator and evaluate the severity of regurgitation postimplantation. Results: In total seven consecutive patients (mean age 72.8 +/- 5.6 years, 86% male) with a history of mitral valve (n = 6) or aortic valve replacement and severe PVL, underwent transapical PVL reduction using seven plugs in total (diameter 10-14 mm). Preprocedural median logistic EuroSCORE was 28.5% (range 17.1-41.1%) and NYHA functional class was >= 3 in all patients. The procedure was successful in all patients, with a median fluoroscopic time of 18.7 min (range 10.1-29.6 min). Postprocedure 3D-TEE showed occlusion of PVL in three patients, and significant reduction in three patients. Postprocedural complication was a hematothorax requiring surgery in one patient. Median hospitalization duration after the procedure was 5 days (range 5-59 days). At 3-month follow-up one patient died, functional class and LDH did not differ significantly and there was a significant increase in hemoglobin. Conclusions: Transapical paravalvular leak reduction might be a good or rather attractive alternative in high-risk patients for major re-do cardiac surgery. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Hospital-level associations with 30-day patient mortality after cardiac

AB Background: Marginal and multilevel logistic regression methods can estimate associations between hospital-level factors and patient-level 30-day mortality outcomes after cardiac surgery. However, it is not widely understood how the interpretation of hospital-level effects differs between these methods.
   Methods: The Australasian Society of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons (ASCTS) registry provided data on 32,354 patients undergoing cardiac surgery in 18 hospitals from 2001 to 2009. The logistic regression methods related 30-day mortality after surgery to hospital characteristics with concurrent adjustment for patient characteristics.
   Results: Hospital-level mortality rates varied from 1.0% to 4.1% of patients. Ordinary, marginal and multilevel regression methods differed with regard to point estimates and conclusions on statistical significance for hospital-level risk factors; ordinary logistic regression giving inappropriately narrow confidence intervals. The median odds ratio, MOR, from the multilevel model was 1.2 whereas ORs for most patient-level characteristics were of greater magnitude suggesting that unexplained between-hospital variation was not as relevant as patient-level characteristics for understanding mortality rates. For hospital-level characteristics in the multilevel model, 80% interval ORs, IOR-80%, supplemented the usual ORs from the logistic regression. The IOR-80% was (0.8 to 1.8) for academic affiliation and (0.6 to 1.3) for the median annual number of cardiac surgery procedures. The width of these intervals reflected the unexplained variation between hospitals in mortality rates; the inclusion of one in each interval suggested an inability to add meaningfully to explaining variation in mortality rates.
   Conclusions: Marginal and multilevel models take different approaches to account for correlation between patients within hospitals and they lead to different interpretations for hospital-level odds ratios.

AB Background Various methods can be applied to build predictive models for the clinical data with binary outcome variable. This research aims to explore the process of constructing common predictive models, Logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT) and multilayer perceptron (MLP), as well as focus on specific details when applying the methods mentioned above: what preconditions should be satisfied, how to set parameters of the model, how to screen variables and build accuracy models quickly and efficiently, and how to assess the generalization ability (that is, prediction performance) reliably by Monte Carlo method in the case of small sample size.
   Methods All the 274 patients (include 137 type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic peripheral neuropathy and 137 type 2 diabetes mellitus without diabetic peripheral neuropathy) from the Metabolic Disease Hospital in Tianjin participated in the study. There were 30 variables such as sex, age, glycosylated hemoglobin, etc. On account of small sample size, the classification and regression tree (CART) with the chi-squared automatic interaction detector tree (CHAID) were combined by means of the 100 times 5-7 fold stratified cross-validation to build DT. The MLP was constructed by Schwarz Bayes Criterion to choose the number of hidden layers and hidden layer units, alone with levenberg-marquardt (L-M) optimization algorithm, weight decay and preliminary training method. Subsequently, LR was applied by the best subset method with the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to make the best used of information and avoid overfitting. Eventually, a 10 to 100 times 3-10 fold stratified cross-validation method was used to compare the generalization ability of DT, MLP and LR in view of the areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUC).
   Results The AUC of DT, MLP and LR were 0.8863, 0.8536 and 0.8802, respectively. As the larger the AUC of a specific prediction model is, the higher diagnostic ability presents, MLP performed optimally, and then followed by LA and DT in terms of 10-100 times 2-10 fold stratified cross-validation in our study. Neural network model is a preferred option for the data. However, the best subset of multiple LA would be a better choice in view of efficiency and accuracy.
   Conclusion When dealing with data from small size sample, multiple independent variables and a dichotomous outcome variable, more strategies and statistical techniques (such as AIC criteria, L-M optimization algorithm, the best subset, etc.) should be considered to build a forecast model and some available methods (such as cross-validation, AUC, etc.) could be used for evaluation.

AB Aim: To ratify previous validations of the CONUT nutritional screening tool by the development of two probabilistic models using the parameters included in the CONUT, to see if the CONUT's effectiveness could be improved.
   Methods: It is a two step prospective study. In Step 1, 101 patients were randomly selected, and SGA and CONUT was made. With data obtained an unconditional logistic regression model was developed, and two variants of CONUT were constructed: Model 1 was made by a method of logistic regression. Model 2 was made by dividing the probabilities of undernutrition obtained in model 1 in seven regular intervals. In step 2, 60 patients were selected and underwent the SGA, the original CONUT and the new models developed. The diagnostic efficacy of the original CONUT and the new models was tested by means of ROC curves. Both samples 1 and 2 were put together to measure the agreement degree between the original CONUT and SGA, and diagnostic efficacy parameters were calculated.
   Results: No statistically significant differences were found between sample 1 and 2, regarding age, sex and medical/surgical distribution and undernutrition rates were similar (over 40%). The AUC for the ROC curves were 0.862 for the original CONUT, and 0.839 and 0.874, for model 1 and 2 respectively. The kappa index for the CONUT and SGA was 0.680.
   Conclusions: The CONUT, with the original scores assigned by the authors is equally good than mathematical models and thus is a valuable tool, highly useful and efficient for the purpose of Clinical Undernutrition screening. (Nutr Hosp. 2012;27:564-571) DOI:10.3305/nh.2012.27.2.5630

AB Introduction: This study examines the development of collaborative relationships between family physicians (FPs) and Anticipatory And Preventative Team Care (APTCare) team members providing care to medically complex patients who have been identified as at-risk for negative health outcomes.
   Methods: We undertook a qualitative study of a primary health care intervention in a family practice. Interviews were held with FPs and ATPCare intervention nurse practitioners (NPs) and pharmacists. Focus groups were conducted and a survey was administered to participating FPs, NPs, and pharmacists. NPs and pharmacists maintained a log recording their tasks and moments of collaboration.
   Results: Scheduling demands rendered face-to-face collaboration difficult, leaving the team to rely on technological tools to keep in touch. Limited space meant the APTCare team had to work out of a downstairs office, limiting informal interactions with the practitioners on the main level.
   Conclusions: We demonstrate that the difficulties inherent in collaborative care are independent of the patient population being cared for. Regardless of the patient population and sector of health care, developing collaborative relationships and learning to work collaboratively is difficult and takes time. What many of these teams need is ongoing support and education about how to make these collaborative care practices work. (J Am Board Fam Med 2012;25:168-176.)

AB Clinical supervision (CS) has been identified within nursing as a process for improving clinical practice and reducing the emotional burden of nursing practice. Little is known about its implementation across large tertiary referral hospitals. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the implementation of clinical supervision across several different nursing specialities at a teaching hospital in Sydney, Australia. Using a model of nursing implementation science, a process was developed at the study site that facilitated the development, implementation and evaluation of the project. After a 6-month study period, the CS groups were postevaluated using a survey tool developed for the project. A total of nine CS groups were in operation over the 6-month study period. A predominant focus within the sessions was one of the collegial support and developing standards of practice. The process was able to achieve wide hospital-based support for the role of CS from the senior nurse executives to junior nurses. Whilst there was overall positive support for the CS groups, logistical and resource challenges remain, in the effective roll out of CS to large numbers of nurses.

AB Sepsis is one of the main causes of death for non-coronary ICU (Intensive Care Unit) patients and has become the 10th most common cause of death in western societies. This is a transversal condition affecting immunocompromised patients, critically ill patients, post-surgery patients, patients with AIDS, and the elderly. In western countries, septic patients account for as much as 25% of ICU bed utilization and the pathology affects 1-2% of all hospitalizations. Its mortality rates range from 12.8% for sepsis to 45.7% for septic shock.
   The prediction of mortality caused by sepsis is, therefore, a relevant research challenge from a medical viewpoint. The clinical indicators currently in use for this type of prediction have been criticized for their poor prognostic significance. In this study, we redescribe sepsis indicators through latent model-based feature extraction, using factor analysis. These extracted indicators are then applied to the prediction of mortality caused by sepsis. The reported results show that the proposed method improves on the results obtained with the current standard mortality predictor, which is based on the APACHE II score. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objectives: This study investigated what clinical and sociodemographic factors affected Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) factor scores of patients with schizophrenia to evaluate parameters or items of the WCST.
   Design: Cross-sectional study.
   Setting: Patients with schizophrenia from three hospitals participated.
   Participants: Participants were recruited from July 2009 to August 2011. 131 Japanese patients with schizophrenia (84 men and 47 women, 43.5 +/- 13.8 years (mean +/- SD)) entered and completed the study. Participants were recruited in the study if they (1) met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia; (2) were physically healthy and (3) had no mood disorders, substance abuse, neurodevelopmental disorders, epilepsy or mental retardation. We examined their basic clinical and sociodemographic factors (sex, age, education years, age of onset, duration of illness, chlorpromazine equivalent doses and the positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) scores).
   Primary and secondary outcome measures: All patients carried out the WCST Keio version. Five indicators were calculated, including categories achieved (CA), perseverative errors in Milner (PEM) and Nelson (PEN), total errors (TE) and difficulties of maintaining set (DMS). From the principal component analysis, we identified two factors (1 and 2). We assessed the relationship between these factor scores and clinical and sociodemographic factors, using multiple logistic regression analysis.
   Results: Factor 1 was mainly composed of CA, PEM, PEN and TE. Factor 2 was mainly composed of DMS. The factor 1 score was affected by age, education years and the PANSS negative scale score. The factor 2 score was affected by duration of illness.
   Conclusions: Age, education years, PANSS negative scale score and duration of illness affected WCST factor scores in patients with schizophrenia. Using WCST factor scores may reduce the possibility of type I errors due to multiple comparisons.

AB Introduction: Several risk factors have been used to predict preeclampsia. The role of some risk factors as predictors associated with preeclampsia among Iranian women was analyzed in the present study using logistic regression. Materials and Methods: 610 women attending the obstetric ward of Mustafa hospital in Ilam were enrolled in this study. Demographic variables such as age, Body Mass Index (BMI), medical and obstetrics variables such as education, number of pregnancy, abortion and parity from May to September 2010 were analyzed. We used the unvaried and multiple logistic regression analyses to predict preeclampsia. Results: The history of preeclampsia, hypertension, and infertility showed to be good independent predicator variables for preeclampsia using multivariate logistic regression analysis (OR was 5.46, 2.34 and 3.07 respectively). Area Under the Receiver Operation Character (AUROC) was estimated to be 0.67 (95% CI 0.59-0.67, p<0.01) indicating the efficacy of the model for the prediction. Conclusion: The history of preeclampsia, hypertension and infertility predict preeclampsia with an increased odds ratio. Using such variables in regression analysis can help to diagnose preeclampsia beforehand and hence allow timely intervention.

AB Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of the additive and logistic EuroSCOREs in predicting the operative mortality in patients undergoing aortic valve replacement (AVR) with or without coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.
   Design: This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data.
   Setting: This was a single-center study performed in an educational hospital.
   Participants: All patients (n = 1,885) who underwent AVR with (n = 813) or without (n = 1,072) CABG surgery between 1998 and 2007.
   Interventions: AVR with or without CABG surgery.
   Measurements and Main Results: Variable life-adjusted display curves were constructed to compare the observed operative mortality with the additive and logistic EuroSCOREs. The receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was used to determine the discriminatory power of the additive and logistic EuroSCOREs. Calibration between the predicted and the observed operative mortality was checked by comparing the predicted probability of the mortality with the additive and logistic EuroSCORE. In the isolated AVR group, the additive EuroSCORE was 5.8% predicted mortality and the logistic EuroSCORE was 7.2%, whereas the observed operative mortality was 3.2%. In the AVR with CABG surgery group, the additive EuroSCORE was 7.2% and the logistic EuroSCORE was 8.8%, Whereas the observed operative mortality was 5.3%. ROC curve analyses showed a high discriminatory power for both EuroSCOREs in both patient groups.
   Conclusions: Although the additive and the logistic EuroSCOREs had good discriminatory power, they were not able to predict the actual operative mortality accurately. Both EuroSCOREs overestimated the operative mortality, especially in low-risk patients. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

DE ordinal regression; pain; prehospital; vital signs
ID EMERGENCY; ANALGESIA; OUTCOMES
AB Objective To determine whether vital signs in patients suffering from acute pain in the out-of-hospital setting have any association with pain severity measured using an ordinal pain scale.
   Materials and methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of over 53 000 adult patients aged between 16 and 100 years, who presented to paramedics complaining of acute pain between 1 January 2004 and 30 November 2006. Simple correlation (Spearman's) and ordinal logistic regression techniques were used to create a proportional odds model to explore the relationship between patient-reported pain score and initial vital signs including respiratory rate, pulse rate and blood pressure.
   Results There was a weak but significant correlation between respiratory rate and initial pain score (R = 0.15, P<0.0001). In patients aged 16 years and above, those with an initial respiratory rate of 25 breaths/min or more had significantly increased odds (45-105%) of having more severe pain than patients with a respiratory rate of less than 25 breaths/min (P<0.0001). In younger patients (aged between 16 and 64 years), a heart rate of 100 beats/min or more was associated with 18% increased odds of more severe pain (P<0.0001). In older patients (aged between 65 and 100 years), systolic blood pressure of 140mmHg or more was associated with 14% increased odds of more severe pain (P<0.0001).
   Conclusion An association between prehospital vital signs and pain severity has been shown using ordinal logistic regression. In adults, a respiratory rate of 25 breaths/min or more was the most important predictor of having more severe pain. Tachycardia and systolic hypertension may also be important in younger and older patients, respectively. Simple correlation fails to show clinically important associations between prehospital vital signs and pain severity.

AB Introduction: The Amsterdam Trauma Workflow (ATW) concept includes a sliding gantry CT scanner serving two mirrored (trauma) rooms. In this study, several predefined scenarios with a varying number of CT scanners and CT locations are analyzed to identify the best performing patient flow management strategy from an institutional perspective on process quality.
   Materials and methods: A total of six clinically relevant scenarios with variables that included the number of CT scanners, CT scanner location, and different patient categories (regular, urgent, and trauma patients) were evaluated using computer simulation. Each scenario was simulated using institutional data and was assessed for patient waiting times, idle time of CT scanners, and overtime due to scheduling. The best 2- and 3-scanner scenarios were additionally evaluated with the ATW-concept.
   Results: Based on institutional data, the best 2-scanner scenario distributes all 3 patient categories over both scanners and plans 4 urgent patients per hour while locating both scanners outside of the trauma room. The best 3-scanner scenario distributes urgent and regular patients over all 3 scanners and trauma patients on only 1 scanner and locates all CT scanners outside of the trauma room. The ATW concept reduces waiting times and overtime, while increasing idle time.
   Conclusion: Choosing the optimal planning and distribution strategies depends on the number and location of available CT scanners, along with number of trauma, urgent and regular patients. The Amsterdam Trauma Workflow concept could provide institutions with the ability of early CT scanning in trauma patients without influencing regular and urgent CT scanning.

AB Background: The accuracy of the logistic EuroSCORE in different patient populations has been questioned. Using the German registry database, the KoronarCHirurgie (KCH) scorewas introduced as a preoperative risk stratification tool specifically for patients who undergo isolated coronary artery bypass surgery in Germany. However, no direct statistical comparison of this score with the well-established logistic EuroSCORE has been previously performed. The aim of this study was to validate the preoperative German KCH score and to compare it to the logistic EuroSCORE for all coronary artery bypass surgery patients as well as for on-pump and off-pump subgroups.
   Methods: We prospectively included all consecutive adult patients admitted to our department between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2008, who underwent isolated coronary artery bypass surgery. The logistic EuroSCORE and the KCH-3.0 were calculated on admission to hospital. The outcome was defined as 30-day mortality. We performed calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow test and Anderson-Grunkemeier Observed/Expected "O/E" mortality ratio) and discrimination (receiver operating characteristic "ROC" test) analyses of both scores. The accuracy of the scores was compared using DeLong's test.
   Results: A total of 1461 patients (23.96% females, mean age 66.94 +/- 9.43 years) were included. The 30-day mortality rate was 2.87%. The two models were comparable with regard to the prediction of an individual patient's risk of mortality in the whole study population and in the on-pump and off-pump subgroups (according to the ROC test and DeLong's test). Overall, there was no significant difference between observed and expected mortality according to the Hosmer-Lemeshow test (p > 0.05). However, the KCH-3.0 was far less likely to overpredict mortality than the logistic EuroSCORE, as demonstrated by the observed mortality/expected mortality (O/E) ratios. The O/E ratio was 0.32 for the logistic EuroSCORE and 0.74 for the KCH-3.0. For the on-pump subgroup the O/E ratios were 0.37 and 0.80, respectively, and 0.24 and 0.63, respectively, for the off-pump subgroup.
   Conclusions: The KCH-3.0 is more reliable than the logistic EuroSCORE as a preoperative mortality prediction score for patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass surgery, providing predicted mortality rates that are closer to the actual mortality rates with a lower overprediction of mortality.

DT Article
DE Computer simulation; Financial management, Hospital; Logistic models
ID PLATELET PRODUCTION; OPTIMIZATION
AB Background: The blood supply chain is a complex system that considers different interconnected elements that have to be synchronized correctly to satisfy in quality and quantity the final patient requirements. Aim: To determine the blood center maximum production capacity, as well as the determination of the necessary changes for a future production capacity expansion. Material and Methods: This work was developed in the Blood Center of Concepcion, Chile, operations management tools were applied to model it and to propose improvement alternatives for the production process. The use of simulation is highlighted, which permitted the replication of the center behavior and the evaluation of expansion alternatives. Results: It is possible to absorb a 100% increment in blood demand, without making major changes or investments in the production process. Also it was possible to determine the subsequent steps in terms of investments in equipment and human resources for a future expansion of the center coverage. Conclusions: The techniques used to model the production process of the blood center of Concepcion, Chile, allowed us to analyze how it operates, to detect "bottle necks", and to support the decision making process for a future expansion of its capacity (Rev Med Chile 2011; 139: 1150-1156).

TI Adjusting for a cluster effect in the logistic regression model: an
   illustration of theory and its application
SO JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF SRI LANKA
LA English
DT Article
DE Cluster effect; Huber formula; logistic regression; mixed model; random
   effect
AB When a response having two outcomes is modelled using a logistic model the responses on each observation are often considered to be independent of each other. This assumption may not always be valid and the responses may be correlated with each other as in the case of clustered data, which can occur especially in the case of survey data. When responses are correlated as explained, then the ordinary logistic regression model is unsuitable as the standard errors will be biased, and therefore this model should be adjusted for the cluster effect. In this paper one of the many methods of adjustment suggested in the literature, which is based on robust standard error estimation for cluster sampling data is examined. The objective of this paper is to illustrate the theory and mode of application of this theory by way of using a survey on Paraquet poisoned patients in Sri Lanka. Here, the patients are clustered within hospitals and therefore adjustment of the logistic model for the clustering effect is discussed. Adjusting for the hospital (cluster) effect significantly reduced the standard error of four out of thirty three odds ratios given by the model. That is four odds ratios that were not significant before adjustment became significant after adjustment. There was no change in significance in the other twenty nine odds ratios. On average there is a reduction of 2.29% in the standard error of the odds ratios after adjustment for the cluster effect. This indicates that it is effective and important to adjust for the cluster effect.

   EPIDEMIOLOGY; OUTCOMES; RATES
AB BACKGROUND: Although logistic regression is traditionally used to calculate hospital standardized mortality ratio (HSMR), it ignores the hierarchical structure of the data that can exist within a given database. Hierarchical models allow examination of the effect of data clustering on outcomes.
   STUDY DESIGN: Traditional logistic regression and random intercepts fixed slopes hierarchical models were fitted to a dataset of patients hospitalized between 2005 and 2007 in Massachusetts. We compared the observed to expected (O/E) in-hospital death ratios between the 2 modeling techniques, a restricted HSMR using only those diagnosis models that converged in both methods and a full hybrid HSMR using a combination of the hierarchical diagnosis models when they converge, plus the remaining diagnoses using standard logistic regression models.
   RESULTS: We restricted the analysis to the 36 diagnoses accounting for 80% of in-hospital deaths nationally, based on 1,043,813 admissions (59 hospitals). A failure of the hierarchical models to converge in 15 of 36 diagnosis groups hindered full HSMR comparisons. A restricted HSMR, derived from a dataset based on the 21 diagnosis groups that converged (552,933 admissions) showed very high correlation (Pearson r = 0.99). Both traditional logistic regression and hierarchical model identified 12 statistical outliers in common, 7 with high O/E values and 5 with low O/E values. In addition, the multilevel analysis identified 5 additional unique high outliers and 1 additional unique low outlier, and the conventional model identified 2 additional unique low outliers.
   CONCLUSIONS: Similar results were obtained from the 2 modeling techniques in terms of O/E ratios. However, because a hierarchical model is associated with convergence problems, traditional logistic regression remains our recommended procedure for computing HSMRs. (J Am Coll Surg 2011;213:392-401.

AB Objective: Renal failure requiring dialysis represents a serious complication following cardiac surgery. This study was designed to determine the incidence and predictors of renal failure requiring dialysis in a contemporary patient population. We also aimed to create a model based on these risk factors that could serve as a tool for the prediction of renal failure requiring dialysis. Methods: Between October 2007 and June 2009, 2511 consecutive patients (mean age 69 +/- 12 years, 68% male) underwent on-pump cardiac surgery at our institution. The main outcome investigated was postoperative renal failure requiring temporary or permanent dialysis. Other postoperative parameters included in the analysis were hospital mortality, major morbidity, length of hospital stay, and discharge condition. Predictors of renal failure requiring dialysis were determined using multivariate regression models. The discriminatory power was evaluated by calculating the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curves (c-statistic). Results: Renal failure requiring dialysis occurred in 3.9% (n = 98) of patients. Hospital mortality among patients with dialysis-dependent renal failure was 37.8% compared with a mortality rate of 1.3% in patients without this complication (p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed pulmonary hypertension (odds ratio (OR) = 8.1), preoperative renal dysfunction (creatinine > 2.0 mg dl(-1)) (OR = 4.6), cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time > 120 min (OR = 3.9), peripheral vascular disease (OR = 3.1), previous myocardial infarction (OR = 3.0), atrial fibrillation (OR = 2.8), age > 75 years (OR = 2.6), New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV (OR = 2.5), and diabetes (OR = 2.0) as independent predictors for postoperative renal failure requiring dialysis. A logistic equation including the coefficients of the regression analysis accurately predicted individual patient's risk for the occurrence of renal failure requiring dialysis (area under the ROC curve: 0.829, 95% confidence interval 0.78-0.86). Conclusions: Renal failure requiring dialysis remains a serious complication, particularly in patients with pulmonary hypertension and previous renal dysfunction. Our logistic risk model allows the prediction of renal failure requiring dialysis, based on the individual presentation of risk factors and, therefore, helps to determine the perioperative risk in cardiac surgery patients.

AB We compared the performances of the additive and logistic EuroSCORE in predicting mortality in patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting at a single institution in Pakistan. Both models were applied to 2004 patients, operated upon at the Aga Khan University Hospital from January 2006 to July 2010. The actual mortality (3.8%) was significantly different from the additive (4.35%) and the logistic (6.41%) estimates. On the basis of degree of risk, actual mortality was 0.6% in the low-risk (additive EuroSCORE 0-4), 4.2% in the medium-risk (EuroSCORE 5-9) and 19.1% in the high-risk (EuroSCORE 10-19) group. With the low risks, both systems slightly overestimated mortality, with the logistic EuroSCORE being more accurate. At a EuroSCORE of between 10 and 19, the additive EuroSCORE underestimated and logistic EuroSCORE overestimated mortality. Both models satisfactorily discriminated outcomes (receiver operating characteristics areas of 0.866 and 0.859 for the additive and the logistic model, respectively). The Hosmer-Lemeshow test showed that calibration was good for the additive model (P = 0.424) but turned out to be inadequate for the logistic model (P < 0.001). We conclude that the additive EuroSCORE is a more accurate model for risk assessment compared to the logistics model in the Pakistani population.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate factors that can affect compliance with treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in infertile patients and to provide a basis for clinical treatment, specialist consultation and health education.
   STUDY DESIGN: Patient compliance was assessed via a questionnaire based on the Morisky-Green test and the treatment principles of PCOS. Then interviews were conducted with 99 infertile patients diagnosed with PCOS at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University in China, from March to September 2009. Finally, these data were analyzed using logistic regression analysis.
   RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis revealed that a total of 23 (25.6%) of the participants showed good compliance. Factors that significantly (p<0.05) affected compliance with treatment were the patient's body mass index, convenience of medical treatment and concerns about adverse drug reactions.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients who are obese, experience inconvenient medical treatment or are concerned about adverse drug reactions are more likely to exhibit noncompliance. Treatment education and intervention aimed at these patients should be strengthened in the clinic to improve treatment compliance. Further research is needed to better elucidate the compliance behavior of patients with PCOS. (J Reprod Med 2011;56:325-332)

TI Logistic random effects regression models: a comparison of statistical

DT Article

   DATABASE; LIKELIHOOD; DESIGN
AB Background: Logistic random effects models are a popular tool to analyze multilevel also called hierarchical data with a binary or ordinal outcome. Here, we aim to compare different statistical software implementations of these models.
   Methods: We used individual patient data from 8509 patients in 231 centers with moderate and severe Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) enrolled in eight Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) and three observational studies. We fitted logistic random effects regression models with the 5-point Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) as outcome, both dichotomized as well as ordinal, with center and/or trial as random effects, and as covariates age, motor score, pupil reactivity or trial. We then compared the implementations of frequentist and Bayesian methods to estimate the fixed and random effects. Frequentist approaches included R (lme4), Stata (GLLAMM), SAS (GLIMMIX and NLMIXED), MLwiN (p[R]IGLS) and MIXOR, Bayesian approaches included WinBUGS, MLwiN (MCMC), R package MCMCglmm and SAS experimental procedure MCMC. Three data sets (the full data set and two sub-datasets) were analysed using basically two logistic random effects models with either one random effect for the center or two random effects for center and trial. For the ordinal outcome in the full data set also a proportional odds model with a random center effect was fitted.
   Results: The packages gave similar parameter estimates for both the fixed and random effects and for the binary (and ordinal) models for the main study and when based on a relatively large number of level-1 (patient level) data compared to the number of level-2 (hospital level) data. However, when based on relatively sparse data set, i.e. when the numbers of level-1 and level-2 data units were about the same, the frequentist and Bayesian approaches showed somewhat different results. The software implementations differ considerably in flexibility, computation time, and usability. There are also differences in the availability of additional tools for model evaluation, such as diagnostic plots. The experimental SAS (version 9.2) procedure MCMC appeared to be inefficient.
   Conclusions: On relatively large data sets, the different software implementations of logistic random effects regression models produced similar results. Thus, for a large data set there seems to be no explicit preference (of course if there is no preference from a philosophical point of view) for either a frequentist or Bayesian approach (if based on vague priors). The choice for a particular implementation may largely depend on the desired flexibility, and the usability of the package. For small data sets the random effects variances are difficult to estimate. In the frequentist approaches the MLE of this variance was often estimated zero with a standard error that is either zero or could not be determined, while for Bayesian methods the estimates could depend on the chosen "noninformative" prior of the variance parameter. The starting value for the variance parameter may be also critical for the convergence of the Markov chain.

AB This paper establishes a simulation model for the supply chain of the hospital logistic system (SCHLS) based on the dynamic Taguchi method. The model derives optimal factor level combinations in the SCHLS setting when establishing adjustable contracting capacity between SCHLS and the pharmaceutical company. To attempt the goal, this study adopts the SCHLS case in the North Alliance of the Department of Health of Taiwan. The data collection uses a simulation based on Taguchi's L(18) orthogonal table for SCHLS. This work also proposes an optimal approach, including the neural network (NN) and genetic algorithm (GA), to obtain an optimal robust design in achieving optimal SCHLS multi-performance. The research results show that the predicted response of multi-performance in the optimal approach is better than that in Taguchi. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Logistics innovation process revisited: insights from a hospital case
   study
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL DISTRIBUTION & LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT
LA English

DE Logistics innovation; Logistics processes; Healthcare supply chain;
   Action research; Hospitals; Taiwan
ID PERSPECTIVE; MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to learn more about logistics innovation processes and their implications for the focal organization as well as the supply chain, especially suppliers.
   Design/methodology/approach - The empirical basis of the study is a longitudinal action research project that was triggered by the practical needs of new ways of handling material flows of a hospital. This approach made it possible to revisit theory on logistics innovation process.
   Findings - Apart from the tangible benefits reported to the case hospital, five findings can be extracted from this study: the logistics innovation process model may include not just customers but also suppliers; logistics innovation in buyer-supplier relations may serve as an alternative to outsourcing; logistics innovation processes are dynamic and may improve supplier partnerships; logistics innovations in the supply chain are as dependent on internal stakeholders as on external relationships; and logistics innovation process may start out as a dialectic, conflict ridden process and end up in a well-ordered goal-oriented teleological process.
   Research limitations/implications - In general, the study contributes to the knowledge base of innovation process in logistics that is still sparse although literature on innovation in many other disciplines is well-developed. As this research is only one study highlighting a special context of a hospital, further studies on the dynamic logistics innovation processes and their implications for the relevant parties as well as the supply chain are needed. This study does not claim statistical generalizability of the findings but provides insight into complex organizational processes that, for example, surveys cannot.
   Practical implications - The findings of the study have provided valuable insights into the process of a logistics innovation in an oriental healthcare supply chain context. The study is, however, still limited in disclosing end-to-end supply chain benefits including concrete performance improvements at the suppliers. Examining logistics innovation processes should result not only in the implementation of innovative processes, but also in improved supplier relations leading to improved financial results in the supply chain.
   Originality/value - The paper adds to the knowledge of the dynamic processes of logistics innovation both downstream and upstream in a supply chain. It elaborates on an existing model by methodological triangulation in order to learn more about the qualities of actual processes and their implications for theory and practice.

AB This study assessed the performance of Sequential Organ Failure Assessment, Logistic Organ Dysfunction Score and Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score in outcome prediction in severe sepsis. A total of 528 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of severe sepsis were enrolled from two surgical intensive care units of university hospitals in China. Clinical and laboratory data of patients were collected and admission and maximum values of each scoring system were calculated. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve, which were used to assess discrimination, were 0.80, 0.83 and 0.74 for admission Sequential Organ Failure Assessment, Logistic Organ Dysfunction Score and Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score respectively, and 0.91, 0.93 and 0.86 for corresponding maximum values respectively. Calibration assessed by the Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic was better with admission (chi(2)=18.2) and maximum Logistic Organ Dysfunction Score (chi(2)=19.6) than with admission (chi(2)=98.1) and maximum Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score (chi(2)=30.9). Brier Scores, indicating the overall performance of the scores, were 0.18, 0.17 and 0.22 for admission Sequential Organ Failure Assessment, Logistic Organ Dysfunction Score and Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score respectively, and 0.12, 0.10 and 0.15 for their maximum counterparts respectively This study found good performance of both admission Sequential Organ Failure Assessment and Logistic Organ Dysfunction Score in severe sepsis, and a slightly weaker performance of admission Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score. Since poor calibration was observed in Logistic Organ Dysfunction Score and Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score, we suggest further study of customisation of these scores in critical illness with severe sepsis.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to show how mobile robots are addressing a variety of hospital logistic needs.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper includes in-depth interviews with developers of the Aethon hospital mobile robot logistics system.
   Findings - Robotics can greatly improve hospital logistic services such as moving food, lab samples, prescriptions and even add a bit of entertainment in the process.
   Practical implications - Hospital administrators have new answers to the old challenges of moving items in a timely and cost-effective manner around their facility.
   Originality/value - Hospitals are first implementers of mobile robotics to look for answers to their logistic problems. They do not have to break new ground for themselves.

TI Case Study: An Application of Logistic Regression in a Six Sigma Project
   in Health Care
SO QUALITY ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
DE DMAIC; generalized additive model; logistic regression
ID FIT; MODELS
AB Health care today is facing serious problems: quality of care does not meet patients' needs and costs are exploding. In the cardiology department of the Virga Jesse Hospital in Belgium, discharged patients are advised to participate in a rehabilitation program. However, many of the discharged patients do not join the program, and others quit before being declared cured (a so-called dropout). An improvement project was started that aims to increase revenues by either attracting more patients to the rehabilitation program or reducing the fraction of dropouts.
   A large data set with 516 treated patients was available. We model the probability that a patient joins the program as a function of various numerical and categorical influence factors. First an exploratory data analysis is performed, using bar charts and box plots. This is followed by a more formal statistical analysis using logistic regression.
   The logistic regression model reveals the important influence factors. The probability of joining the program depends on whether a patient has a car at his or her disposal and the distance from a patient's home to the hospital. As a solution, various measures to stimulate carpooling were implemented. Prior to the implementation, a cost-benefit analysis was conducted using the fitted regression model.

AB To identify variables that predict in-hospital length of stay (LOS) after laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR).
   Univariate analysis of patient and intraoperative variables was conducted on an operating room database of LVHRs performed from April 2001 to April 2009. Analysis was performed using either chi-square or linear trend analysis, as appropriate. A multivariate logistic regression model was created manually, to determine independent variables that predict LOS. p Value < 0.05 was considered significant.
   A total of 221 patients, with mean age of 56 years (range 25-88 years) underwent LVHR, for a total of 121 incisional and 100 primary ventral hernias. Of patients, 40% had incarcerated hernias and 25% had complex hernias (defined as multiple points of weakness on the anterior abdominal wall). The overall conversion rate to open operation was 6%. Mean LOS was 1.54 days (range 0-22 days). Eighty-six patients (39%) were discharged on the day of the procedure. Variables associated with significantly longer LOS on univariate analysis were incisional hernia (p = 0.000009), mesh size (p = 0.00007), complex hernia (p = 0.00009), incarcerated hernia (p = 0.0004), patient age (p = 0.0006), need for lysis of adhesions (p = 0.001), and female gender (p = 0.01). American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade > 2, conversion to open procedure, and recurrent hernia were not associated with longer LOS. Four factors were independently associated with significant longer length of stay on multivariate logistic regression analysis (p < 0.05): mesh size (p = 0.00005), incarcerated hernia (p = 0.002), patient age (p = 0.018), and complex hernia (p = 0.035).
   Mesh size, incarcerated hernia, patient age, and complex hernia predict longer length of stay after laparoscopic ventral hernia repair.

AB We aimed to describe the logistics of a prehospital triage system for patients with acute chest pain in the region of Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Ambulance electrocardiograms (ECGs) were evaluated immediately in 1 of the percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)-capable centers. Patients accepted for primary PCI (PPCI) were directly transferred to the catheterization laboratory. Two thousand three hundred fifty ECGs of 2,192 patients were transmitted to the region's intervention centers. Median duration of chest complaints before ambulance dispatch was 67 minutes; ambulance crews recorded the first ECG within 7 minutes after arrival. Actual transmission of the ECG took an additional (median) 10 minutes. Seven hundred eleven patients (32.4%) were transported to the catheter laboratory and were treated with PPCI. Time between first prehospital ECG and start of PPCI procedure was 66 minutes. The PPCI procedure started 36 minutes after ambulance arrival at the hospital. In conclusion, the results of this study compare favorably to other reported performances of prehospital triage systems of PPCI for ST-segment elevated myocardial infarction and demonstrate that the European Society of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines for treatment of patients with ST-segment elevated myocardial infarction can be met.

AB Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a major drug-induced adverse reaction that becomes a dose-limiting toxicity. However, effective strategies for preventing or treating CIPN are lacking. Accordingly, this study aimed to statistically identify predictors for CIPN. Retrospective analysis was carried out for 190 patients who had been treated with bortezomib (n=28), taxanes (paclitaxel or docetaxel; n=58), oxaliplatin (n=52) or vincristine (n=52) at our hospital between April 2005 and December 2008. The severity of CIPN was assessed at the time of chemotherapy completion, graded as grade 0-5 in accordance with the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0. Multivariate ordered logistic regression analysis was used to investigate predictors for CIPN. Predictors for CIPN in patients that were administered bortezomib were no co-administration of dexamethasone [odds ratio (OR), 0.455; confidence interval (CI), 0.208-0.955; P=0.0376] and sex (male) (OR, 3.035; CI, 1.356-6.793; P=0.0069). For taxanes (paclitaxel or docetaxel), the predictor for CIPN was a large number of chemotherapy cycles (OR, 2.379; CI, 1.035-5.466; P=0.0412). For oxaliplatin, the predictors for CIPN were a large number of chemotherapy cycles (OR, 3.089; CI, 1.598-5.972; P=0.0008) and no co-administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (OR, 0.393; CI, 0.197-0.785; P=0.0082). For vincristine, predictors for CIPN were a large number of chemotherapy cycles (OR, 6.015; CI, 1.880-19.248; P=0.0025) and co-administration of an analgesic adjuvant (OR, 3.907; CI, 1.383-11.031; P=0.0101). In conclusion, our study indicates that CIPN will be alleviated by the co-administration of dexamethasone with bortezomib and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with oxaliplatin.

SO COLORECTAL DISEASE
LA English
DT Article
DE Outcome; logistics; emergency; urgent; colorectal; surgery
AB Aim Infrastructure-related factors are seldom described in detail in studies on outcome after surgical procedures. We studied patient, procedure, physician and infrastructure characteristics and their effect on outcome at a Norwegian University hospital.
   Method All patients admitted between 1st January 2002 and 30th June 2003 who underwent urgent or emergency colorectal surgery were extracted from the hospital databases and retrospectively analysed.
   Results There were 196 patients. The overall complication rate was 39%. Forty-six (24%) patients died during admission after surgery. Those who died were less likely to be operated by a subspecialized colorectal surgeon (17% vs 30%, P = 0.001). The anaesthesiologist was a resident in most of the cases (> 75%) for both those who survived and those who died. Surgery performed out-of-office hours was common in both groups, although the patients who died were more likely to be operated upon at night (28% vs 18%, P = 0.001). The time interval standard from admission to surgery was met in only 84 (43%) patients. Forty-nine (49/196, 25%) procedures were delayed beyond the time requested by the surgeon by more than 120 min (mean 363 min).
   Conclusion The outcome after emergency colorectal surgery was consistent with the literature but the infrastructure was not optimal. Improvements may be achieved by a focus on decreasing waiting times, abandoning of out-of-office emergency surgery and increasing the involvement of senior staff.

AB Objective: To compare the predictive accuracy of regression trees with that of logistic regression models for predicting in-hospital mortality in patients hospitalized with heart failure.
   Study Design and Setting: Models were developed in 8,236 patients hospitalized with heart failure between April 1999 and March 2001. Models included the Enhanced Feedback for Effective Cardiac Treatment and Acute Decompensated Heart Failure National Registry (ADHERE) regression models and tree. Predictive accuracy was assessed using 7,608 patients hospitalized between April 2004 and March 2005.
   Results: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for five different logistic regression models ranged from 0.747 to 0.775, whereas the corresponding values for three different regression trees ranged from 0.620 to 0.651. For the regression trees grown in 1,000 random samples drawn from the derivation sample, the number of terminal nodes ranged from 1 to 6, whereas the number of variables used in specific trees ranged from 0 to 5. Three different variables (blood urea nitrogen, dementia, and systolic blood pressure) were used for defining the first binary split when growing regression trees.
   Conclusion: Logistic regression predicted in-hospital mortality in patients hospitalized with heart failure more accurately than did the regression trees. Regression trees grown in random samples from the same data set can differ substantially from one another. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose: Older patients with hip fracture have a mortality rate one year after surgery of 20-30%. The purpose of this study is to establish a predictive model to assess the outcome of surgical treatment in older patients with hip fracture.
   Methods: A database of information from 286 consecutive cases of surgery for hip fracture from the Department of Orthopedics, National Taiwan University Hospital Yun-Lin Branch, was utilised for model building and testing. Both logistic regression and artificial neural network (ANN) models were developed. Cases were randomly assigned to training and testing datasets. A testing dataset was utilised to test the accuracy of both models (n = 89).
   Results: The areas under the receiver operator characteristic curves of both models were utilised to compare predictability and accuracy. The logistic regression training and testing datasets had an area of 0.938 (95% CI: 0.904, 0.972) and 0.784 (95% CI: 0.669, 0.899), respectively, below the 0.998 ( 95% CI: 0.995, 1.000) and 0.949 (95% CI: 0.857, 1.000) of the final ANN model.
   Conclusion: Overall, ANNs have higher predictive ability than logistic regression, perhaps because they are not affected by interactions between factors. They may assist in complex decision making in the clinical setting. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Predicting Risk-Adjusted Mortality for Trauma Patients: Logistic versus
   Multilevel Logistic Models
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURGEONS
LA English
DT Article
ID SURGERY; CARE
AB BACKGROUND: Theoretical advantages of random-intercept multilevel (ML) logistic regression (LR) modeling over standard LR include separating variability due to patient-level and hospital-level predictors, shrinkage of estimates for lower-volume hospitals toward the overall mean, and fewer hospitals falsely identified as outliers.
   STUDY DESIGN: We used Nationwide Inpatient Sample data from 2002 to 2004 to construct LR models of hospital mortality after admission with a principal ICD-9 Clinical Modification injury diagnosis (ICD-9 Clinical Modification codes 800 to 904, 910 to 929, 940 to 957, and 959). After considering various predictors, we used patient-level indicator variables for age groups, gender, maximum Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) for the head region (AIS score 3, 4, or 5), maximum AIS for other body regions (MS score 3, 4, or 5), and mechanisms (eg, fall, gunshot, motor vehicle). Using standard LR and MLLR, we compared predictions based on 2002, 2003, and 2004 data with actual mortality observed in the same hospitals in the 2004, 2005, and 2006 Nationwide Inpatient Samples, respectively.
   RESULTS: Patient-level fixed effects were similar for the 2 methods in all years, with mortality associated most strongly with AIS = 5 head injury, other AIS = 5 injury, or higher age groups. ML models identified fewer hospitals as outliers. Differences between actual and predicted mortality were smaller with MLLR models compared with standard LR models.
   CONCLUSIONS: Multilevel models might have advantages for the measurement and explanation of interhospital differences in trauma patient outcomes. (J Am Coll Surg 2010;211:224-231. (C) 2010 by the American College of Surgeons)

AB To determine if socio-economic status (SES) affects the stage at presentation of head and neck cancer ( HNC) patients in Ottawa, Canada. To determine if the method of diagnosis affects the stage at presentation in these patients. We obtained data on SES, method of diagnosis, and stage at presentation for patients presenting to the head and neck cancer clinic at The Ottawa Hospital Regional Cancer Centre (TORCC). We performed a logistic regression analysis using stage at presentation as the dependent variable. We found no statistically significant association between average family income ( by postal code) and stage at presentation. We found that oral cancers presented at a later stage compared with other HNCs but that who made the diagnosis was an important factor. Oral cancers diagnosed by a dentist had 3.44 times the odds of being at a later stage than other HNCs (CI 1.01-11.96), but oral cancers diagnosed by other means had 11.42 times the odds of being at a later stage than other HNCs. We found that male patients presented at a later stage than female patients (OR 2.62, CI 1.03-6.63). Finally, former smokers had about 1/3 the odds of presenting at a later stage than current smokers (OR 0.33, CI 0.13-0.84) although nonsmokers were not significantly less likely than current smokers to present later ( OR 0.47, CI 0.17-1.32). We found no evidence that in Ottawa, Canada patients of a lower SES with HNC presented at an different stage than patients with higher SES. We found that patients presenting with oral cancers presented at an earlier stage if they were diagnosed by a dentist. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB High microsatellite instability (MSI-H) allows the identification of a subset of colorectal carcinomas associated with good prognosis and a higher incidence of Lynch syndrome. The aim of this work was to assess the interobserver variability and optimize our MSI-H prediction model previously published based on phenotypic features. The validation series collected from five different hospitals included 265 primary colorectal carcinomas from the same number of patients. The eight clinicopathological parameters that integrate our original model were evaluated in the corresponding centers. Homogeneity assessment revealed significant differences between hospitals in the estimation of the growth pattern, presence of Crohn-like reaction, percentage of cribriform structures, and Ki-67 positivity. Despite this observation, our model was globally able to predict MSI-H with a negative predictive value of 97.0%. The optimization studies were carried out with 615 cases and resulted in a new prediction model RERtest8, which includes the presence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes at the expense of the percentage of cribriform structures. This refined model achieves a negative predictive value of 97.9% that is maintained even when the immunohistochemical parameters are left out, RERtest6. The high negative predictive value achieved by our models allows the reduction of the cases to be tested for MSI to less than 10%. Furthermore, the easy evaluation of the parameters included in the model renders it a useful tool for the routine practice and can reinforce other published models and the current clinical protocols to detect the subset of colorectal cancer patients bearing hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancers risk and/or MSI-H phenotype.

AB Objective: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is an important side effect of second-generation anti-psychotics (SGAs). However, many SGA-treated patients with MetS remain undetected. In this study, we trained and validated artificial neural network (ANN) and multiple logistic regression models without biochemical parameters to rapidly identify MetS in patients with SGA treatment.
   Method: A total of 383 patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (DSM-IV criteria) with SGA treatment for more than 6 months were investigated to determine whether they met the MetS criteria according to the International Diabetes Federation. The data for these patients were collected between March 2005 and September 2005. The input variables of ANN and logistic regression were limited to demographic and anthropometric data only. All models were trained by randomly selecting two-thirds of the patient data and were internally validated with the remaining one-third of the data. The models were then externally validated with data from 69 patients from another hospital, collected between March 2008 and June 2008. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to measure the performance of all models.
   Results: Both the final ANN and logistic regression models had high accuracy (88.3% vs 83.6%), sensitivity (93.1% vs 86.2%), and specificity (86.9% vs 83.8%) to identify MetS in the internal validation set. The mean +/- SD AUC was high for both the ANN and logistic regression models (0.934 +/- 0.033 vs 0.922 +/- 0.035, P = .63). During external validation, high AUG was still obtained for both models. Waist circumference and diastolic blood pressure were the common variables that were left in the final ANN and logistic regression models.
   Conclusion: Our study developed accurate ANN and logistic regression models to detect MetS in patients with SGA treatment. The models are likely to provide a noninvasive tool for large-scale screening of MetS in this group of patients.

AB Studies based on aggregated hospital outcome data have established that there is a relationship between nurse staffing and adverse events. However, this result could not be confirmed in Belgium where 96 per cent of the variability of nurse staffing levels over nursing units (belonging to different hospitals) is explained by within-hospital variability. To better appreciate the possible impact of nurse staffing levels on adverse events, we propose a multilevel approach reflecting the complex nature of the data. In particular we suggest a clustered discrete-time logistic model that captures the risks associated with a given unit in the patient's trajectory through the hospital. The model also allows for nurse staffing levels to affect the current and subsequent nursing unit (carry-over effect). In the model 'time' is represented by the sequential number of the nursing unit that the patient is passing through. The model incorporates hospital and nursing unit random effects to express that patients treated in the same hospital and taken care of by nurses of the same unit share a common environment. In this study we used Belgian national administrative databases for the year 2003 to assess the relationship between nurse staffing levels and nurse education variables with in-hospital mortality. The analysis was restricted to elective cardiac surgery patients. Lower nursing unit staffing levels in the general nursing units were associated with high in-hospital mortality in units past the traditional cardiac surgery nursing units.

AB The value of emergency endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) in the setting of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm remains controversial owing to differing results. However, interpretation of published results remains difficult as there is a lack of generally accepted protocols or standard operating procedures. Furthermore, such protocols and standard operating procedures often are reported incompletely or not at all, thereby making interpretation of results difficult. We herein report our integrated logistic system for the endovascular treatment of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms Important components of this system are prehospital logistics, in-hospital treatment logistics, and aftercare Further studies should include details about all of these components, and a description of these logistic components must be included in all future studies of emergency EVAR for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms.

TI Relationship between the logistic EuroSCORE and the Society of Thoracic
   Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality score in patients implanted with
   the CoreValve ReValving System-A Bern-Rotterdam Study

   DETERMINANTS
AB Background Surgical risk scores, such as the logistic EuroSCORE (LES) and Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality (STS) score, are commonly used to identify high-risk or "inoperable" patients for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). In Europe, the LES plays an important role in selecting patients for implantation with the Medtronic CoreValve System. What is less clear, however, is the role of the STS score of these patients and the relationship between the LES and STS.
   Objective The purpose of this study is to examine the correlation between LES and STS scores and their performance characteristics in high-risk surgical patients implanted with the Medtronic CoreValve System.
   Methods All consecutive patients (n = 168) in whom a CoreValve bioprosthesis was implanted between November 2005 and June 2009 at 2 centers (Bern University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland, and Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands) were included for analysis. Patient demographics were recorded in a prospective database. Logistic EuroSCORE and STS scores were calculated on a prospective and retrospective basis, respectively.
   Results Observed mortality was 11.1%. The mean LES was 3 times higher than the mean STS score (LES 20.2% +/- 13.9% vs STS 6.7% +/- 5.8%). Based on the various LES and STS cutoff values used in previous and ongoing TAVI trials, 53% of patients had an LES >= 15%, 16% had an STS >= 10%, and 40% had an LES >= 20% or STS >= 10%. Pearson correlation coefficient revealed a reasonable ( moderate) linear relationship between the LES and STS scores, r = 0.58, P < .001. Although the STS score outperformed the LES, both models had suboptimal discriminatory power (c-statistic, 0.49 for LES and 0.69 for STS) and calibration.
   Conclusions Clinical judgment and the Heart Team concept should play a key role in selecting patients for TAVI, whereas currently available surgical risk score algorithms should be used to guide clinical decision making. (Am Heart J 2010; 159:323-9.)

AB Objectives A low rate of newly developed pressure ulcers is considered as an important quality indicator in nursing However the re suit of a hospital depends not only on the quality of care but on the risk profile of its patients as well Therefore, based on multiple logistic regression models we describe a method for calculating risk adjusted quality indicators in nursing
   Method Based on data of 1,009,989 patients from 1747 hospitals in 2009, we developed two multiple logistic regression models to identify and to weigh a possible joint influence of several risk factors on newly developed pressure ulcers In a further step we calculated risk adjusted rates
   Results Factors remaining in the regression models were micro movements on admission" diabetes mellitus, age and 'days on intensive care unit Based on the cor responding regression coefficients and the logistic function, the expected rate of newly developed pressure ulcers was calculated for every hospital Finally, expected rates and observed rates both were used to calculate risk adjusted rates
   Conclusion The simultaneous consideration of relevant risk factors by means of risk adjusted quality indicators ensures a fair comparison of hospitals

AB Design: Analysis of all emergency medical patients admitted to St James's Hospital (SJH), Dublin, between 1 January 2002 and 31 December 2007. Validation using a dataset of acute medical admissions from Nenagh Hospital 2000-04.
   Methods: Using routinely collected vital signs and laboratory findings, a composite 5-day in-hospital mortality risk score, designated medical admissions risk system (MARS), was developed using an iterative approach involving logistic regression and multivariable fractional polynomials. Results are presented as area under receiver operating characteristics curves (AUROC) as well as Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness-of-fit statistics.
   Results: A total of 10 712 and 3597 unique patients were admitted to SJH and Nenagh Hospital, respectively. The final score included nine variables [age, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, respiratory rate, temperature, urea, potassium (K), haematocrit and white cell count]. The AUROC for 5-day in-hospital mortality was 0.93 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92-0.94] for the SJH cohort (Hosmer and Lemeshow test, P = 0.32) and 0.92 (95% CI 0.90-0.94) for the external Nenagh hospital validation cohort (Hosmer and Lemeshow test, P = 0.28).
   Conclusions: In-hospital mortality estimation using only routinely collected emergency department admission data is possible in unselected acute medical patients using the MARS system. Such a score applied to acute medical patients at the time of admission, could assist senior clinical decision makers in promptly and accurately focusing limited clinical resources. Further studies validating the impact of this model on clinical outcomes are warranted.

TI Risk Adjustment in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical
   Quality Improvement Program: A Comparison of Logistic Versus
   Hierarchical Modeling
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURGEONS
LA English
DT Article
ID PROFILING HOSPITAL PERFORMANCE; STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY; MORTALITY;
   OUTCOMES; CARD
AB BACKGROUND: Although logistic regression has commonly been used to adjust for risk differences in patient and case mix to permit quality comparisons across hospitals, hierarchical modeling has been advocated as the preferred methodology, because it accounts for clustering of patients within hospitals. It is unclear whether hierarchical models would yield important differences in quality assessments compared with logistic models when applied to American College of Surgeons (ACS) National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) data. Our objective was to evaluate differences in logistic versus hierarchical modeling for identifying hospitals with outlying Outcomes in the ACS-NSQIP.
   STUDY DESIGN: Data from ACS-NSQIP patients who underwent colorectal operations in 2008 at hospitals that reported at least 100 operations were used to generate logistic and hierarchical prediction models for 30-day morbidity and mortality. Differences in risk-adjusted performance (ratio of observed-to-expected events) and outlier detections from the two models were compared.
   RESULTS: Logistic and hierarchical models identified the same 25 hospitals is morbidity outliers (14 low and 11 high outliers), but the hierarchical model identified 2 additional high outliers. Both models identified the same eight hospitals as mortality Outliers (five low and three high outliers). The values of observed-to-expected events ratios and p values from the two models were highly correlated. Results were similar when data were permitted from hospitals providing < 100 patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: When applied to ACS-NSQIP data, logistic and hierarchical models provided nearly identical results with respect to identification of hospitals' observed-to-expected events ratio outliers. As hierarchical models are prone to implementation problems, logistic regression will remain ail accurate and efficient method for performing risk adjustment of hospital quality comparisons.

AB The aim of this study was to analyze the association between the probability of death, number and type of organ dysfunction at the admission in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) according to the Logistic Organ Dysfunction System (LODS) and the variables: length of stay (LOS), discharge and readmission in the Unit. This prospective longitudinal study included 600 adult patients from general ICU of four hospitals in Sao Paulo City. The results showed association between probability of death and discharge of the Unit. (p<0.001). It was also observed association between the number of organ dysfunction and the variables discharge (p<0.001) and LOS in the Unit (p<0.001). Besides, there was association between the type of organ dysfunction and LOS only in the group of patients with neurological (p<0.001), pulmonary (p<0.001) and renal (p<0.001) dysfunctions. No association was observed between readmission in the ICU and the variables analyzed.

TI Predicting the chance of weaning dysphagic stroke patients from enteral

AB Aim. The aim of this article was to develop a simple predictive model of dysphagia. outcome for stroke patients. The study enrolled patients recovering from first-ever stroke (supratentorial lesions) staying in a long-term rehabilitation hospital. On admission, all patients were being fed via nasogastric or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube.
   Methods. Functional Independence Measure (FIM (TM)) scores were assessed on admission. FIM-motor and cognition score, age, days after onset on admission were set as explanatory variables. Target criteria were defined as dichotomous categories; completely oral feeding or any need for nutrition via tube feeding. Multivariate logistic analysis was performed on these data.
   Results. Thirty patients were enrolled: age range was 50-94 (median 75) years; FIM-motor scores spanned 13 to 17 (median 13), FIM-cognition scores spanned 5 to 19 (median 9); and days from stroke onset to transfer to long-term rehabilitation care ranged from 15 to 64 (median 43.5) days. Of these patients, 12 were weaned back to oral feeding and 18 were not. Multivariate logistic regression modelling was successful on these data (P=0.0003, R(2)=0.518; Logit=0.770XFIM-motor+0.089xFIM-cognition -0.070xdays after onset -0.255xage+10.222). Estimated probability for return to oral feeding is nearly 10% when logit equals -2, 50% when logit equals 0, nearly 90% when logit equals 2.
   Conclusion. A logit formula factoring in age, FIM scores, and days after stroke onset can readily predict oral feeding outcome. Further studies are needed to assess external validation to establish wide clinical applicability of this prediction model.

AB The purpose of this study was to identify the financial features that distinguish dividend-paying firms from non-dividend-paying companies in the U.S. hospitality industry. The logistic regression model shows that firm size and profitability are significant drivers of dividend payout, whereas investment opportunities deter dividend payout. In the U.S. hospitality industry, larger hospitality firms with higher profitability but fewer investment opportunities are more likely to pay out dividends to their shareholders.

AB A total of 1586 FCXM, performed between June 2007 and September 2008, between all potential deceased donors in our region and sera from patients awaiting kidney or kidney-pancreas transplant, listed at Northwestern Memorial Hospital were evaluated.
   A key finding of this analysis was the understanding that a thorough vXM cannot be performed in some donor/recipient pairs due to the lack of certain antibody profile data specific to the donor in question. Obtaining more in depth and stringent information regarding antibody specificities, we demonstrate an excellent sensitivity and specificity of the vXM assays- 86.1% and 96.8%, respectively, with a positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratios of 26.9 and 0.14, respectively.
   The vXM can serve as an outstanding tool to predict HLA compatibility between donor and recipient, with the caveat that the presence/absence of all antibodies against the potential donor and their strength have been thoroughly investigated.

AB Objective: Periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) is part of a spectrum of cerebral white matter injury which is associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcome in preterm infants. While PVL is common in neonates with cardiac disease, both before and after surgery, it is less common in older infants with cardiac disease. Pre-, intra-, and postoperative risk factors for the occurrence of PVL are poorly understood. The main objective of the present work is to identify potential hemodynamic risk factors for PVL occurrence in neonates with complex heart disease using logistic regression analysis and decision tree algorithms.
   Methods: The postoperative hemodynamic and arterial blood gas data (monitoring variables) collected in the cardiac intensive care unit of Children's Hospital of Philadelphia were used for predicting the occurrence of PVL. Three categories of datasets for 103 infants and neonates were used-(1) original data without any preprocessing, (2) partial data keeping the admission, the maximum and the minimum values of the monitoring variables, and (3) extracted dataset of statistical features. The datasets were used as inputs for forward stepwise logistic regression to select the most significant variables as predictors. The selected features were then used as inputs to the decision tree induction algorithm for generating easily interpretable rules for prediction of PVL.
   Results: Three sets of data were analyzed in SPSS for identifying statistically significant predictors (p < 0.05) of PVL through stepwise logistic regression and their correlations. The classification success of the Case 3 dataset of extracted statistical features was best with sensitivity (SN), specificity (SP) and accuracy (AC) of 87, 88 and 87%, respectively. The identified features, when used with decision tree algorithms, gave SN, SP and AC of 90, 97 and 94% in training and 73, 58 and 65% in test. The identified variables in Case 3 dataset mainly included blood pressure, both systolic and diastolic, partial pressures pO(2) and pCO(2), and their statistical features like average, variance, skewness (a measure of asymmetry) and kurtosis (a measure of abrupt changes). Rules for prediction of PVL were generated automatically through the decision tree algorithms.
   Conclusions: The proposed approach combines the advantages of statistical approach (regression analysis) and data mining techniques (decision tree) for generation of easily interpretable rules for PVL prediction. The present work extends an earlier research [Galli KK, Zimmerman RA, Jarvik GP, Wernovsky G, Kuijpers M, Clancy RR, et at. Periventricular leukomalacia is common after cardiac surgery. J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2004;127:692-704] in the form of expanding the feature set, identifying additional prognostic factors (namely pCO(2)) emphasizing the temporal variations in addition to upper or Lower values, and generating decision rules. The Case 3 dataset was further investigated in Part II for feature selection through computational intelligence. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To make hospitals more patient-centered it is necessary to intervene on patient flow logistics. The study analyzes three innovative redesign projects implemented at three Italian hospitals. The three hospitals have reorganized patient flow logistics around patient care needs using, as proxies, the expected length of stay and the level of nursing assistance. In order to do this, they have extensively revised their logistical configuration changing: (1) the organization of wards, (2) the hospital's physical lay-out, (3) the capacity planning system, and (4) the organizational roles supporting the patient flow management. The study describes the changes implemented as well as the results achieved and draws some general lessons that provide useful hints for those other hospitals involved in such type of redesign projects. The paper ends by discussing some policy implications. In fact, the results achieved in the three cases investigated provide interesting material for further discussion on clinical, operational, and economic issues.

AB Purpose: The 70-gene prognosis-signature is a prognostic tool for early breast cancer analysis. in addition to scientific evidence, implementation of the signature in clinical trials and daily practice requires logistical feasibility. The aim of our study was to test logistics for gene expression profiling on fresh frozen tumour tissue in the preparation for the prospective, multinational Microarray in Node-negative Disease may Avoid Chemo-Therapy (MIN-DACT) trial.
   Methods: Sixty-four patients were included in six European hospitals. Fresh frozen tumour samples were shipped on dry ice to Agendia B.V., where RNA was isolated and subsequently hybridised on the 70-gene prognosis-signature (MammaPrint(TM)).
   Results: Tumour samples were obtained in 60 of 64 patients. Among the 60 samples, 11 contained insufficient turnout cells (<50%) and three contained insufficient RNA quality. All 46 samples eligible for genomic profiling were successfully hybridised, and the results were reported on average within 4-5 d.
   Conclusion: Gene expression profiling on fresh frozen tissue is feasible in daily clinical practice. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: A prediction model based on clinical and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis has been proposed for the differentiation of Lyme meningitis (LM) from non-Lyme aseptic meningitis (NLAM) in the United States. No similar model has ever been proposed for European patients. The objective of our study was to develop a prediction model to differentiate LM from NLAM based on clinical and CSF biologic data.
   Methods: The medical charts of all children older than 2 years of age admitted to our hospital from 1996 through 2006 with a definite diagnosis of LM were analyzed and compared retrospectively with those having a diagnosis of NLAM. Chart review included the duration of symptoms, the presence of cranial neuropathy, and CSF analysis.
   Results: A total of 93 patients were included (LM: 26 patients; NLAM: 67 patients) in the study. Patients with LM had statistically more frequent cranial neuropathy (73% vs. 4%), displayed a longer duration of symptoms before admission (8.8 vs. 1.8 days), had a higher CSF protein (71 vs. 38 mg/d), and had a lower percentage of neutrophil cells in the CSF (3.4% vs. 51%) than patients with NLAM. A predicted probability was derived from these 4 variables. At a cutoff point of >0.432, the model had a negative predictive value of 100% and a positive predictive value of 92.3%, with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 97%.
   Conclusions: We report the first European prediction model for LM. Owing to its high negative predictive value, this model may assist physicians in managing aseptic meningitis (AM) while awaiting serologic tests, especially in Lyme endemic regions.

TI Using ordinal logistic regression to evaluate the performance of
   laser-Doppler predictions of burn-healing time

AB Background: Laser-Doppler imaging (LDI) of cutaneous blood flow is beginning to be used by burn surgeons to predict the healing time of burn wounds; predicted healing time is used to determine wound treatment as either dressings or surgery. In this paper, we do a statistical analysis of the performance of the technique.
   Methods: We used data from a study carried out by five burn centers: LDI was done once between days 2 to 5 post burn, and healing was assessed at both 14 days and 21 days post burn. Random-effects ordinal logistic regression and other models such as the continuation ratio model were used to model healing-time as a function of the LDI data, and of demographic and wound history variables. Statistical methods were also used to study the false-color palette, which enables the laser-Doppler imager to be used by clinicians as a decision-support tool.
   Results: Overall performance is that diagnoses are over 90% correct. Related questions addressed were what was the best blood flow summary statistic and whether, given the blood flow measurements, demographic and observational variables had any additional predictive power ( age, sex, race, % total body surface area burned (%TBSA), site and cause of burn, day of LDI scan, burn center). It was found that mean laser-Doppler flux over a wound area was the best statistic, and that, given the same mean flux, women recover slightly more slowly than men. Further, the likely degradation in predictive performance on moving to a patient group with larger % TBSA than those in the data sample was studied, and shown to be small.
   Conclusion: Modeling healing time is a complex statistical problem, with random effects due to multiple burn areas per individual, and censoring caused by patients missing hospital visits and undergoing surgery. This analysis applies state-of-the art statistical methods such as the bootstrap and permutation tests to a medical problem of topical interest. New medical findings are that age and % TBSA are not important predictors of healing time when the LDI results are known, whereas gender does influence recovery time, even when blood flow is controlled for. The conclusion regarding the palette is that an optimum three-color palette can be chosen 'automatically', but the optimum choice of a 5-color palette cannot be made solely by optimizing the percentage of correct diagnoses.

AB Objective: To clarify the relationships of cancer pain with various factors that prevent pain control statistically.
   Methods: The participants were 71 terminal cancer patients admitted to file Department of Hematology/Oncology or Department of Gastroentrology/Hepatology, University Hospital, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine in whose pain control it pharmacist was involved as part of her clinical duties from January 2004 to November 2006. The effectiveness of pain control was evaluated using a 5-point verbal rating scale (0 = excellent, 1 = good, 2 = moderate, 3 = poor, and 4 = very poor) by interviewing the patients. As pain was rated using it graded scale and as many factors were involved in pain, analysis was performed using ordered logistic regression analysis. Moreover, prediction of an optimal model was performed by leave-one-out cross-validation to eliminate unnecessary variables. A program to perform leave-one-out cross-validation by ordered logistic regression analysis was prepared, independent variables used in the model were increased one by one, and Calculation was performed in all combinations. Then, the optimal model wits predicted by calculating the percent accuracy of predictions and Spearman rank correlation coefficient.
   Results: Nausea [odds ratio (OR) = 1.948, P = 0.0232], sex (OR = 2.322, P = 0.0030), and bone metastasis (OR = 2.367, P = 0.0017) remained as variables significantly correlated with pain when the number of independent variables was 5, and sex (OR = 2.167, P = 0.006) and bone metastasis (OR = 2.093, P = 0.005) remained when the number of variables was 6.
   Discussion: The statistical identification of factors preventing pain control is considered to contribute 10 the establishment of an evidence-based approach to cancer pain relief.

AB Objective: To develop a model that uses individual and lesion characteristics to help surgeons choose lesions that have a high probability of containing histologically confirmed endometriosis.
   Design: Secondary analysis of prospectively collected information.
   Setting: Government research hospital in the United States.
   Patient(s): Healthy women 18-45 years of age, with chronic pelvic pain and possible endometriosis, who were enrolled in a clinical trial.
   Intervention(S): All participants underwent laparoscopy, and information was collected on all visible lesions.. Lesion data were randomly allocated to a training and test data set. !
   Main Outcome Measure(S): Predictive logistic regression, with the outcome of interest being histologic diagnosis of endometriosis.
   Result(s): After validation, the model was applied to the complete data set, with a sensitivity of 88.4% and specificity of 24.6%. The positive predictive value was 69.2%, and the negative predictive value was 53.3%, equating to correct classification of a lesion or 66.5%. Mixed color; larger width; and location in the ovarian fossa, colon, or appendix were most strongly associated with the presence of endometriosis.
   Conclusion(s): This model identified characteristics that indicate high and low probabilities of biopsy-proven endometriosis. It is useful as a guide in choosing appropriate lesions for biopsy, but the improvement using the model is not great enough to replace histologic confirmation of endometriosis.

AB Background/Aims: To define if a new function improves the capability of the scanning laser polarimetry with variable corneal compensation (GDx-VCC) nerve fiber analyzer in detecting preperimetric glaucoma using 12 retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) peripapillary sectors. Methods: Data were obtained in a cross-sectional, hospital-clinic-based study in which 478 eyes from 478 glaucoma suspects were enrolled. All of them underwent ophthalmological examination, static automated perimetry (Humphrey 24-2Swedish interactive threshold algorithm), optic nerve stereoscopic photography, red-free digital RNFL photography and GDx-VCC examination. The overall intake included 391 normal eyes and 60 preperimetric glaucoma eyes with defects in the fiber layer photographs. Results: The mean values of inferior average, temporal-superior-nasal-inferior temporal average, superior average and the number (nerve fiber indicator) were significantly lower in the eyes with RNFL defects than in the control group, when compared with the obtained linear discriminating function. The area under the curve values for receiver-operating characteristics analysis of the new parameter were 5% better than the best GDx-VCC standard values. Conclusions: Our results confirm that the new function has a better diagnostic reliability in preperimetric glaucoma and confirms the usefulness of morphological diagnosis between normal and early damaged RNFLs.

SO BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING

AB Background: Several models for mortality prediction have been constructed for critically ill patients with haematological malignancies in recent years. These models have proven to be equally or more accurate in predicting hospital mortality in patients with haematological malignancies than ICU severity of illness scores such as the APACHE II or SAPS II [1]. The objective of this study is to compare the accuracy of predicting hospital mortality in patients with haematological malignancies admitted to the ICU between models based on multiple logistic regression (MLR) and support vector machine (SVM) based models.
   Methods: 352 patients with haematological malignancies admitted to the ICU between 1997 and 2006 for a life-threatening complication were included. 252 patient records were used for training of the models and 100 were used for validation. In a first model 12 input variables were included for comparison between MLR and SVM. In a second more complex model 17 input variables were used. MLR and SVM analysis were performed independently from each other. Discrimination was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (+/- SE).
   Results: The area under ROC curve for the MLR and SVM in the validation data set were 0.768 (+/- 0.04) vs. 0.802 (+/- 0.04) in the first model (p = 0.19) and 0.781 (+/- 0.05) vs. 0.808 (+/- 0.04) in the second more complex model (p = 0.44). SVM needed only 4 variables to make its prediction in both models, whereas MLR needed 7 and 8 variables in the first and second model respectively.
   Conclusion: The discriminative power of both the MLR and SVM models was good. No statistically significant differences were found in discriminative power between MLR and SVM for prediction of hospital mortality in critically ill patients with haematological malignancies.

AB The aim of this work was to develop two logistic regression models capable of predicting physical and mental health related quality of life (HRQOL) among rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. In this cross-sectional study which was conducted during 2006 in the outpatient rheumatology clinic of our university hospital, Short Form 36 (SF-36) was used for HRQOL measurements in 411 RA patients. A cutoff point to define poor versus good HRQOL was calculated using the first quartiles of SF-36 physical and mental component scores (33.4 and 36.8, respectively). Two distinct logistic regression models were used to derive predictive variables including demographic, clinical, and psychological factors. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of each model were calculated. Poor physical HRQOL was positively associated with pain score, disease duration, monthly family income below 300 US$, comorbidity, patient global assessment of disease activity or PGA, and depression (odds ratios: 1.1; 1.004; 15.5; 1.1; 1.02; 2.08, respectively). The variables that entered into the poor mental HRQOL prediction model were monthly family income below 300 US$, comorbidity, PGA, and bodily pain (odds ratios: 6.7; 1.1; 1.01; 1.01, respectively). Optimal sensitivity and specificity were achieved at a cutoff point of 0.39 for the estimated probability of poor physical HRQOL and 0.18 for mental HRQOL. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the physical and mental models were 73.8, 87, 83.7% and 90.38, 70.36, 75.43%, respectively. The results show that the suggested models can be used to predict poor physical and mental HRQOL separately among RA patients using simple variables with acceptable accuracy. These models can be of use in the clinical decision-making of RA patients and to recognize patients with poor physical or mental HRQOL in advance, for better management.

AB Background: Previous studies have been unable to identify independent valve-related risk factors for postoperative respiratory failure (RF) in patients undergoing valve surgery. This study was designed to determine the incidence and predictors of RF in these patients. We also aimed to create a model based on these risk factors that could serve as a tool for the prediction of this complication. Methods: We analyzed prospectively collected data of 2808 patients (mean age 63 15 years, 43% female) who underwent valve surgery from January 1998 to December 2006. Isolated valve surgery was performed in 2007 (72%) patients whereas 801 (28%) received concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) procedures. The main outcome investigated was RF (ventilation >72 h). Other postoperative parameters included in the analysis were hospital mortality, morbidity, length of hospital stay, discharge and late survival. Results: Respiratory failure occurred in 12.2% (n = 342) of patients. The incidence of RF varied according to the procedures (single valve: 7.4-15.8%; multiple valves: 21.7-23.4%). The addition of CABG significantly increased the rate of RF (isolated valves: 10.8%, combined valve/CABG 15.7%, p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed preoperative renal failure, ejection fraction <30%, age >70 years, active endocarditis, emergent procedures, reoperation, diabetes, congestive heart failure, previous myocardial infarction, female gender, double aortic and mitral valve procedures, and cardiopulmonary bypass time >180 min as independent predictors of RE Hospital mortality among patients with RF was 22.2% (n = 76) versus 2.7% (n = 66) in the control group (p < 0.001). A logistic equation including the coefficients of the regression analysis was generated to calculate an individual patient's risk for the development of RF Predictive accuracy of the model and validation was measured (ROC area under the curve: 0.751). Long-term survival of discharged patients with RF was significantly decreased compared to those without RE Conclusion: Respiratory failure is a common complication particularly in patients undergoing complex valve operations such as endocarditis or multiple valve procedures. The independent predictors of RF including valve-related factors allowed us to create a predictive model with great accuracy. The poor long-term survival of patients with RF underlines the need to direct more resources towards prevention and treatment of this complication.

AB Noninvasive risk stratification of patients who have suffered myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the greatest challenges in today's cardiology. No single test has sufficient predictive ability. Therefore, a combination of the tests must be applied for better post-MI risk stratification. The purpose of this study was to assess noninvasive predictors of 2 years cardiac mortality in post-MI patients and create a stratification model for identification of high-risk patients. Clinical, electrocardiographic, and echocardiographic parameters were evaluated before hospital discharge in 180 survivors of acute MI (mean age 57.0 +/- 9.9, male 82.2%), followed up for 2 years. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine informative predictors of cardiac mortality. A clinical score was constructed using the regression coefficient from the multivariate model. During follow-up, 16 deaths (8.8%) occurred. Multivariate analysis identified a combination of six variables that showed the strongest association with cardiac mortality. Based on the coefficients of the logistic regression, six variables were used to create a scoring system: filtered QRS duration (QRSd) > 114 ms, coefficient of variation (Cv) <= 2.5%, maximal corrected QT interval (QTcmax) >= 445 ms, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <= 30%, the absence of use of beta-blockers (BB), and absence of treatment by primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The cutoff value for the score of 10 or higher, defined the "high-risk" patients with a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 70%. The mortality rate for the low-and high-risk groups were 12.5% and 87.5%, respectively. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis yielded area under curve of 0.88. The proposed scoring system could be valuable in predicting 2 years risk of cardiac mortality in post-MI population and allows the stratification of patients into low- and high-risk groups.

AB The accuracy of the logistic EuroSCORE (logES), a widely used risk prediction algorithm for cardiac surgery including aortic valve surgery, usually overestimates observed perioperative mortality. Elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in symptomatic patients with. aortic stenosis (AS) is associated with a poor short-term outcome after aortic valve replacement. We aimed to compare BNP with the logES for predicting short- and long-term outcome in symptomatic patients with severe AS undergoing aortic valve replacement. We prospectively studied 144 consecutive patients referred for aortic valve replacement (42% women, 73 +/- 9 years, mean aortic gradient 51 +/- 18 mm Hg, and left ventricular ejection fraction 61 +/- 11%) undergoing either isolated aortic valve replacement (58%) or combined to bypass grafting. Both plasma BNP and logES was estimated before surgery. The median BNP plasma level and logES were 157 pg/ml (interquartile range [IQR] 61 to 440) and 6.6% (IQR 4.2 to 12.2), respectively. The perioperative mortality was 6% and the overall mortality by the end of the study was 13 %. Patients with logES > 10.1% (upper tertile) had a higher risk of dying over time (hazard ratio [HR] 2.86, p = 0.037), as had patients with BNP >312 pg/ml (HR 9.01, p <0.001). Discrimination (based on C statistic) and model performance (based on Akaike information criterion) were better for BNP than for logES. At the bivariable analysis, only BNP was an independent predictor of death (HR 8.2, p = 0.002). Preoperative BNP was even more accurate than logES in predicting outcome. in conclusion, in symptomatic patients with severe AS, high preoperative BNP plasma level and high logES confirm their predicting value for short- and long-term outcome.

AB Objectives: Using cohorts examined by extended biopsy, we developed and validated multivariate models predicting prostate cancer on initial biopsy and examined whether these extended biopsy-based models outperform previously established models.
   Methods: Initial extended biopsy (median 22 cores) was performed in 1509 Japanese men including 1083 at Tokyo Medical and Dental University Hospital (TMDU) and 426 at Cancer Institute Hospital (CIH). Logistic regression-based nomograms 1 and artificial neural network (ANN) 1 incorporating age, digital rectal examination, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and free PSA, and nomogram 2 and ANN2 further incorporating transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) findings and prostate volume were constructed on the TMDU data. These and previously established models were externally validated on the CIH data set and predictive accuracy was compared directly.
   Results: Without TRUS-derived information, nomogram I outperformed the ANN1. With TRUS-derived information, nomogram 2 was more accurate than ANN2. External validation revealed applicability of the Western models to Japanese population, superiority of the nomograms over ANN models, and better predictive accuracy of our extended biopsy-based nomograms than the previous 6-10-core biopsy-based models. Using nomograms 1 and 2, 16% and 19% unnecessary biopsies would be saved at 95% sensitivity.
   Conclusions: We developed new nomograms predicting prostate cancer on initial biopsy in men with PSA < 20 ng/ml. Predictive accuracy of these extended biopsy-based nomograms is better than those of previously established models based on 6-10-core biopsies. Our models might help clinicians to decide if a patient requires biopsy and to avoid unnecessary biopsies. (C) 2008 European Association of Urology. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The implementation of diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) sharply increased economic pressure on hospitals. Hence, process optimization was focussed on cost-intensive areas, namely the operation room (OR) departments. Work-flow in the OR is characterized by a mandatory interlocking of the job functions of many different occupational groups and the availability of a variety of different materials. Alternatives for staff assignment optimization have been published in numerous publications dealing with the importance of OR management. In this connection the issue of material logistics in the context of OR management has not been frequently addressed. In order to perform a surgical procedure according to plan, one depends on personnel and on timely availability of the materials needed. Supply of sterilized materials is of utmost importance, because in most hospitals sterilized surgical devices constitute a critical resource. In order to coordinate the OR process with the production flow of sterilized materials, an organizational connection to the OR management makes sense. Hence, in a German university hospital the Department of Hospital Sterile Supplies was integrated into the OR management of the Department of Anesthesiology. This led to a close coordination of work-flow processes, and concomitantly a significant reduction of production costs of sterile supplies could be achieved by direct interaction with the OR. Thus, hospital sterile supplies can reasonably be integrated into an OR management representing a new interesting business area for OR organization.

AB Objectives: Owing to the large number of injury International Classification of Disease-9 revision (ICD-9) codes, it is not feasible to use standard regression methods to estimate the independent risk of death for each injury code. Bayesian logistic regression is a method that can select among a large numbers of predictors without loss of model performance. The purpose of this study was to develop a model for predicting in-hospital trauma deaths based on this method and to compare its performance with the ICD-9-based Injury Severity Score (ICISS).
   Methods: The authors used Bayesian logistic regression to train and test models for predicting mortality based on injury ICD-9 codes (2,210 codes) and injury codes with two-way interactions (243,037 codes and interactions) using data from the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB). They evaluated discrimination using area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) and calibration with the Hosmer-Lemeshow (HL) h-statistic. The authors compared performance of these models with one developed using ICISS.
   Results: The discrimination of a model developed using individual ICD-9 codes was similar to that of a model developed using individual codes and their interactions (AUC = 0.888 vs. 0.892). Inclusion of injury interactions, however, improved model calibration (HL h-statistic = 2,737 vs. 1,347). A model based on ICISS had similar discrimination (AUC = .855) but showed worse calibration (HL h-statistic = 45,237) than those based on regression.
   Conclusions: A model that incorporates injury interactions had better predictive performance than one based only on individual injuries. A regression approach to predicting injury mortality based on injury ICD-9 codes yields models with better predictive performance than ICISS.

AB Purpose: Ever since National Health Insurance was introduced in 1995, the number of insurants increased to over 96% from So to 60%, with a continuous satisfaction rating of about 70%. However, the premium accounted for 5.77% of GDP in 2001 and the Bureau of National Health Insurance had pressing financial difficulties, so it reformed its expenditure systems, such as fee for service, capitation, case payment and the global budget system in order to control the rising medical costs. Since the change in health insurance policy, most hospitals attempted to reduce their operating expenses and improve efficiency. Introducing the electronic logistics information system is one way of reducing the cost of the department of central warehouse and the nursing stations. Hence, the study proposes a technology acceptance research model and examines how nurses' acceptance of the e-logistics information system has been affected in the medical industry.
   Methods: This research combines innovation diffusion theory, technology acceptance model and added two research parameters, trust and perceived financial cost to propose a new hybrid technology acceptance model. Taking Taiwan's medical industry as an experimental example, this paper studies nurses' acceptance of the electronic logistics information system. The structural equation modeling technique was used to evaluate the causal model and confirmatory factor analysis was performed to examine the reliability and validity of the measurement model.
   Results: The results of the survey strongly support the new hybrid technology acceptance model in predicting nurses' intention to use the electronic logistics information system.
   Conclusion: The study shows that 'compatibility', 'perceived usefulness', 'perceived ease of use', and 'trust' all have great positive influence on 'behavioral intention to use'. On the other hand 'perceived financial cost' has great negative influence on behavioral intention to use. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper deals with the optimization of the flow of sterile instruments in hospitals which takes place between the sterilization department and the operating theatre. This topic is especially of interest in view of the current attempts of hospitals to cut cost by outsourcing sterilization tasks. Oftentimes, outsourcing implies placing the sterilization unit at a larger distance, hence introducing a longer logistic loop, which may result in lower instrument availability, and higher cost. This paper discusses the optimization problems that have to be solved when redesigning processes so as to improve material availability and reduce cost. We consider changing the logistic management principles, use of visibility information, and optimizing the composition of the nets of sterile materials.

AB Study Objective: To investigate whether systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) decreases during the preintubation period could be expressed as 4-parameter logistic and cubic functions giving S-shaped curves.
   Design: Prospective, clinical study.
   Setting: Operating room of a metropolitan general hospital.
   Patients: Seven ASA physical status I and II patients scheduled for elective spinal surgery during general anesthesia.
   Interventions: Anesthesia was induced with fentanyl, propofol, and vecuronium injection followed by inhalation of sevoflurane.
   Measurements: The SBP and DBP data were recorded at all beats from fentanyl injection to direct laryngoscopy. The respective changes were analyzed using a logistic function: P(t) = P-L + (q(L) - P-L)/(1 + exp {[4 m(L)/(q(L) - P-L)][k(L) - t]}) and a cubic function: P(t) = at(3) + bt(2) + ct + d, where parameter P-L is the upper asymptote, q(L) is the lower asymptote, m(L) is the slope at the inflection point, and k(L), is the time to the inflection point and where a, b, and c are coefficients, and d are constants. Goodness of fit of the two functions was compared using a correlation coefficient and residual mean squares. Each parameter was compared with the corresponding observed data.
   Main Results: Logistic correlation coefficient values for SBP and DBP decreases were larger than the cubic correlation coefficient values (0.990 [Z transformation: 2.64 +/- 0.32] vs 0.981 [Z: 2.32 +/- 0.37] and 0.977 [Z: 2.22 +/- 0.33] vs 0.967 [Z: 2.05 +/- 0.34], respectively, P < 0.05). Logistic residual mean squares values for SBP and DBP decreases were smaller than cubic residual mean squares values (20.6 vs 41.0 and 9.2 vs 13.7 mmHg(2), respectively; P < 0.05). There were significant correlations between P-L and SBP or DBP after anesthesia induction, between q(L) and SBP or DBP before endotracheal intubation, and between k(L) and time to maximal rate of the SBP or DBP decrease (dP/dt(min)), but no significant correlation between m(L) and dP/dt(min) for SBP or DBP.
   Conclusions: Time courses of SBP and DBP decreases during the preintubation period of anesthesia induction are modeled effectively by a logistic function. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Clinicians and health service researchers are frequently interested in predicting patient- specific probabilities of adverse events (e.g. death, disease recurrence, post-operative complications, hospital readmission). There is an increasing interest in the use of classification and regression trees (CART) for predicting outcomes in clinical studies. We compared the predictive accuracy of logistic regression with that of regression trees for predicting mortality after hospitalization with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We also examined the predictive ability of two other types of data-driven models: generalized additive models (GAMs) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS). We used data on 9484 patients admitted to hospital with an AMI in Ontario. We used repeated split-sample validation: the data were randomly divided into derivation and validation samples. Predictive models were estimated using the derivation sample and the predictive accuracy of the resultant model was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve in the validation sample. This process was repeated 1000 times-the initial data set was randomly divided into derivation and validation samples 1000 times, and the predictive accuracy of each method was assessed each time. The mean ROC curve area for the regression tree models in the 1000 derivation samples was 0.762, while the mean ROC curve area of a simple logistic regression model was 0.845. The mean ROC curve areas for the other methods ranged from a low of 0.831 to a high of 0. 85 1. Our study shows that regression trees do not perform as well as logistic regression for predicting mortality following AML However, the logistic regression model had performance comparable to that of more flexible, data-driven models such as GAMs and MARS.

   distribution problem; integer multi-commodity network flow problem
ID LOCATION-ROUTING PROBLEM; NETWORK
AB This paper describes an integrated location-distribution model for coordinating logistics support and evacuation operations in disaster response activities. Logistics planning in emergencies involves dispatching commodities (e.g., medical materials and personnel, specialised rescue equipment and rescue teams, food, etc.) to distribution centres in affected areas and evacuation and transfer of wounded people to emergency units. During the initial response time it is also necessary to set up temporary emergency centers and shelters in affected areas to speed up medical care for less heavily wounded survivors. In risk mitigation studies for natural disasters, possible sites where these units can be situated are specified according to risk based urban structural analysis. Logistics coordination in disasters involves the selection of sites that result in maximum coverage of medical need in affected areas. Another important issue that arises in such emergencies is that medical personnel who are on duty in nearby hospitals have to be re-shuffled to serve both temporary and permanent emergency units. Thus, an optimal medical personnel allocation must be determined among these units. The proposed model also considers this issue.
   The proposed model is a mixed integer multi-commodity network flow model that treats vehicles as integer commodity flows rather than binary variables. This results in a more compact formulation whose output is processed to extract a detailed vehicle route and load instruction sheet. Post processing is achieved by a simple routing algorithm that is pseudo-polynomial in the number of vehicles utilized, followed by the solution of a linear system of equations defined in a very restricted domain. The behavior and solvability of the model is illustrated on an earthquake scenario based on Istanbul's risk grid as well as larger size hypothetical disaster scenarios. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

TI Computer assisted optimization of in-hospital workflow: the logistics of

AB Surgical patient care is a complex organization task. On the one hand, it involves numerous specialties, e. g., radiologists, surgeons, anaesthesiologists, operation room nurses, auxiliary OR staff. On the other, it heavily relies on hospital logistics, e. g., OR scheduling, hospital warehouse management and accounting. Numerous individual computer applications assist the care team throughout the treatment process. Unfortunately, the stand-alone nature of these applications intrinsically hinders information transfer across specialities and between process steps. We have analyzed the peri-operative workflow in an orthopaedic trauma setting and identified bottle-necks in in-hospital information dissemination. We subsequently developed an integrated application to facilitate information processing along the peri-operative workflow. Our application merges innovative three-dimensional surgical planning with hospital warehouse management and logistics. Quality of patient care will increasingly depend on integrating existing medical systems to a central information turntable. It is thereby essential that such an application depicts the entire peri-operative treatment process. Process optimization through integration could likewise be applied to other surgical disciplines.

AB Purpose At the request of the French Health authorities, a study called CADEUS (COX-2 inhibitors and NSAIDs: description of users) aimed to describe the users of cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors and traditional non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (tNSAIDs). We report here the methodology, logistics and study design performances.
   Methods CADEUS is a cohort study designed to include 40000 patients randomly sampled monthly in the French National Healthcare Insurance database, who received at least one dispensation of celecoxib, rofecoxib or tNSAIDs (1: 1:2), from September 2003 to August 2004. Patients and prescribers were asked to fill a questionnaire on indication, medical history, risk factors and hospitalizations since drug acquisition. There was no reminder. For each respondent, healthcare resources used for the 6 months before and after inclusion were extracted from the database. Response rate, response delay, responders and non-responders characteristics were assessed.
   Results Of the 222 879 patients and their prescribers contacted, 20.8% patients and 32.6% prescribers responded. Median response delay was 16 days for patients and 17 days for physicians. Factors associated with patient response were age, cohort, type of prescriber and period of inclusion.
   Conclusion This is the first study of this design in France, combining data from a claims database and direct patient and prescriber questionnaires. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Objective: To develop a multivariate prediction model for in-hospital mortality following aortic valve replacement. Methods: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data on 4550 consecutive patients undergoing aortic valve replacement between 1 April 1997 and 31 March 2004 at four hospitals. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was undertaken, using the forward stepwise technique, to identify independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was calculated to assess the performance of the model. The statistical model was internally validated using the technique of bootstrap resampling, which involved creating 100 random samples, with replacement, of 70% of the entire dataset. The model was also validated on 816 consecutive patients undergoing aortic valve replacement between 1 April 2004 and 31 March 2005 from the same four hospitals. Results: Two hundred and seven (4.6%) in-hospital deaths occurred. Independent variables identified with in-hospital mortality are shown with relevant co-efficient values and p-values as follows: (1) age 70-75 years: 0.7046, p < 0.001; (2) age 75-85 years: 1.1714, p < 0.001; (3) age > 85 years: 2.0339, p < 0.001; (4) renal dysfunction: 1.2307, p < 0.001; (5) New York Heart Association class IV: 0.5782, p = 0.003; (6) hypertension: 0.4203, p = 0.006; (7) atrial. fibrillation: 0.604, p = 0.002; (8) ejection fraction < 30%: 0.571, p = 0.012; (9) previous cardiac surgery: 0.9193, p < 0.001; (10) non-elective surgery: 0.5735, p < 0.001; (11) cardiogenic shock: 1.1291, p = 0.009; (12) concomitant CABG: 0.6436, p < 0.001. Intercept: -4.8092. A simplified additive scoring system was also developed. The ROC curve was 0.78, indicating a good discrimination power. Bootstrapping demonstrated that estimates were stable with an average ROC curve of 0.76, with a standard deviation of 0.025. Validation on 2004-2005 data revealed a ROC curve of 0.78 and an expected mortality of 4.7% compared to the observed rate of 4.1%. Conclusions: We developed a contemporaneous multivariate prediction model for in-hospital mortality following aortic valve replacement. This toot can be used in day-to-day practice to calculate patient-specific risk by the logistic equation or a simple scoring system with an equivalent predicted risk.

AB This paper presents an innovative approach for improving hospital logistics by coordinating the procurement and distribution operations while respecting inventory capacities. Instead of focusing on multi-echelon inventory decisions, our approach put the emphasis on the scheduling decisions: when to buy a product, when to deliver to each care unit, when each employee should work and what task should he do, etc. This promising strategy requires the elaboration of coordinated schedules that balance the activities through the purchasing cycle. We introduce two modelling approaches that can account for the numerous scheduling decisions in such environment. We present a tabu search metaheuristic that explores four different neighborhoods and which accommodates the two modelling approaches. We tested our models and algorithms on a real case extracted from a hospital based in Montreal, Canada. The supply schedules generated by our algorithm were considered by the hospital managers as efficient and well balanced. The approach may help hospitals to improve their logistics by better coordinating purchasing and procurement. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The International Classification of Disease Injury Severity Score (ICISS) and the Trauma Registry Abbreviated Injury Scale Score (TRAIS) are trauma injury severity scores based on probabilities of survival. They are widely used in logistic regression models as raw probability scores to predict the logit of mortality. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether these severity indicators would offer a more accurate prediction of mortality if they were used with a logit transformation.
   Methods: Analyses were based on 25,111 patients from the trauma registries of the four Level I trauma centers in the province of Quebec, Canada, abstracted between 1998 and 2005. The ICISS and TRAIS were calculated using survival proportions from the National Trauma Data Bank. The performance of the ICISS and TRAIS in their widely used form, proportions varying from 0 to 1, was compared with a logit transformation of the scores in logistic regression models predicting in-hospital mortality. Calibration was assessed with the Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic.
   Results: Neither the ICISS nor the TRAIS had a linear relation with the logit of mortality. A logit transformation of these scores led to a near-linear association and consequently improved model calibration. The Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic was 68 (35-192) and 69 (41-120) with the logit transformation compared with 272 (227-339) and 204 (166-266) with no transformation, for the ICISS and TRAIS, respectively.
   Conclusions: in logistic regression models predicting mortality, the ICISS and TRAIS should be used with a logit transformation. This study has direct implications for improving the validity of analyses requiring control for injury severity case mix.

AB Background: Recent upper respiratory infection (URI) in children increases respiratory adverse events following anesthesia for elective surgery. The increased risk continues weeks after resolution of acute URI symptoms. Few systematic analyses have explored specific risk factors. This logistic regression explores the relationship between preoperative URI symptoms and adverse events during emergence from anesthesia.
   Methods: Data were combined from control groups of several prospective observational and interventional studies in elective pediatric anesthesia in a tertiary care pediatric hospital. In each study, a blinded observer, distinct from the anesthesia care team, prospectively recorded the presence of stridor, oxygen desaturations (and their duration), coughing and laryngospasm. Parents were subsequently asked about the presence of 10 cold symptoms during the 6 weeks prior to operation.
   Results: Our model, based on a dataset of 335 patients, did not demonstrate an association between any particular symptoms and the rate of respiratory adverse events during emergence from anesthesia, with the exception of low-grade fever which appeared to be mildly protective. Respiratory adverse events were affected by the airway management technique (device used and timing of extubation), and adverse events were increased if peak URI symptoms had occurred within the preceding 4 weeks.
   Conclusions: Specific preoperative symptoms were not useful in predicting respiratory adverse events during emergence from anesthesia.

AB Introduction: Acute exacerbations of disease symptoms in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) often lead to hospitalization and impose a great financial burden on the health care system. Nonetheless, there is a paucity of data regarding the predictors of disease exacerbation in these patients. This study aimed to determine factors which can predict rehospitalization in COPD patients.
   Material and methods: A total of 157 COPD patients were selected via systematic sampling from all the patients admitted to the Chest Clinic of Baqiyataliah Hospital during the year 2006. Subjects were followed for 12 months for the occurrence of any disease exacerbation that led to hospitalization. Demographic data [gender, age, marital status, monthly income (less than 200 $, and equal to or higher than 200 $), level of education (below diploma and diploma or higher)], spirometric findings (percent predicted vital capacity (VC % predicted), percent predicted FVC (FVC % predicted), and percent predicted FEV1 (FEV1 % predicted)], physical comorbidity (assessed by Ifuclu index), presence of anxiety or depression (evaluated by the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale), and body mass index (BMI) were recorded for each patient. Multivariate regression was applied to find out the predicting factors of disease exacerbation.
   Results: Over the 12-month period, 87 (55%) experienced disease exacerbation. Significant associations were found between COPD exacerbation and monthly income (p=0.001), comorbidity score (p=0.05), anxiety (p=0.013) and depression (p=0.025). VC % predicted, FVC % predicted and FEV1 % predicted had no significant association with disease exacerbation (p>0.05). Predictors of COPD exacerbation were found to be monthly income lower than 200 $ (p=0.002), higher comorbidity score (p=0.05) and depression (p=0.05). A prediction equation was designed to help clinicians predict disease exacerbation.
   Conclusions: Physical comorbidity, severity of depression and tow income can be used to predict COPD exacerbation. We recommend that more attention be given to these predictors.

SO HEART
LA English
DT Article
ID ADDITIVE EUROSCORE; STRATIFIED MORTALITY; LIMITATIONS; POPULATION;
   CORONARY; MODELS
AB Objectives: To study the ability of the logistic EuroSCORE to predict operative risk in contemporary cardiac surgery.
   Design: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data.
   Setting: All National Health Service centres undertaking adult cardiac surgery in northwest England.
   Patients: All patients undergoing cardiac surgery between April 2002 and March 2004.
   Main outcome measures: The predictive ability of the logistic EuroSCORE was assessed by analysing how well it discriminates between patients with differing observed risk by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and studying how well it is calibrated against observed in-hospital mortality. The performance of the EuroSCORE was examined in the following surgical subgroups: all cardiac surgery, isolated coronary artery surgery, isolated valve surgery, combined valve and coronary surgery, mitral valve surgery, aortic valve surgery and other surgery.
   Results: 9995 patients underwent surgery. The discrimination of the logistic EuroSCORE was good with a ROC curve area of 0.79 for all cardiac surgery (range 0.71-0.79 in the subgroups). For all operations, the predicted mortality was 5.7% and observed mortality was 3.3%. The logistic EuroSCORE overpredicted observed mortality for all subgroups but by differing degrees (p = 0.02)
   Conclusions: The logistic EuroSCORE is a reasonable overall predictor for contemporary cardiac surgery but overestimates observed mortality. Its accuracy at predicting risk in different surgical subgroups varies. The logistic EuroSCORE should be recalibrated before it is used to gain reassurance about outcomes. Caution should be exercised when using it to compare hospitals or surgeons with a different operative case mix.

AB Considering the relatively short history of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), the amount of available evidence of efficacy is impressive, and effectiveness studies are now required. Transfer of our experimentally gained knowledge into the real world raises issues that call for synchronization among the many specialists involved in chronic heart failure (CHF) management and CRT decision making. From an economic perspective, the demonstrated ability of CRT to reduce hospitalizations could help ease the burden on health systems derived from the growing incidence of CHF. Recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline revisions should encourage a synchronized approach to rational deployment of CRT in selected patients. Nevertheless, current QRS criteria for CRT candidacy do not directly address the key issue of identification of patients with a pacing-correctable mechanical dyssynchrony (and in clinical trials, 25-30% of implanted patients did not respond to CRT). Echocardiography could become an important adjunct (or even an alternative) to QRS duration for patient selection; routine implementation would require use of straightforward, reproducible measurements, possibly obtainable on standard equipment. Echocardiography could also help optimize site location, although this would not eliminate lead placement problems. A series of issues remain open for investigation, including the potential of CRT in patients with atrial fibrillation, impact of devices with defibrillation ability, effects of electrical/pharmacological tailoring, need for confirmation that efficacy of CRT extends into the long term and possible use of CRT in mild CHF. Interdisciplinary synchronization in the various phases of CRT (screening, proposing, implementing, optimizing and monitoring) should eventually help develop a coordinated system for patient referral.

AB Objective: Risk stratification in thoracic aortic surgery is a topic of major interest. Recent studies have shown the European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE) to be an extremely useful and reliable risk stratification score and also a good indicator of quality of care in cardiac surgery. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the significance of the additive and logistic EuroSCOREs in patients undergoing surgery on the thoracic aorta in Japan. Methods: We calculated the predicted mortality according to the additive and logistic EuroSCORE algorithms in 327 consecutive patients who underwent surgery of the thoracic aorta during a 30-year period (between 1976 and 2005). We compared the score validity between the two algorithms and also evaluated the score validity for the patients who underwent thoracic aortic surgery. The score validity was assessed by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results: The overall in-hospital mortality was 13%. The area under the ROC curve was satisfactorily high for the additive (0.68, 0.73, 0.73) as well as the logistic EuroSCORE (0.69, 0.74, 0.75) in the patients who underwent thoracic aortic surgery during 30-, 20-, and 10-year periods, respectively. The actual mortality was 7% (Group 1; an additive EuroSCORE of 3-6), 16% (Group 2; 7-11), and 37% (Group 3; > 12). The mortality expected by the additive and logistic EuroSCORE in the three different risk groups were (5%, 9%, 19%) and (5%, 14%, 43%), respectively. Namely, the mortality expected by the logistic EuroSCORE perfectly matched with the actual mortality in any of the three risk groups. In contrast, the mortality expected by the additive EuroSCORE tended to dissociate when the number of risks increased. Significant difference was observed between the observed mortality and the mortality expected by the additive EuroSCORE algorithm in the high-risk group (p = 0.0473). Conclusions: Although both the additive and the logistic EuroSCORE reliably predicted the overall operative mortality for thoracic aortic surgery in 327 Japanese patients, the logistic EuroSCORE better matched with the actual mortality in the operative risk especially in the high-risk group.

AB Objective: To assess the relationships between independence levels of single motor-related Functional Independence Measure (FIM (TM)) items and summed FIM-motor scores of patients with hemiplegia after stroke.
   Design: For each patient FIM scores were assessed 4 times during hospitalization. Ordinal logistic analyses were performed on group data.
   Subjects: Fifty patients with hemiplegia after stroke staying in a long-term rehabilitation facility.
   Results: Analyses revealed that FIM-motor scores accounted for much of the variability of independence levels for most of the single FIM (TM) items, including dressing upper body, and transfers to bed/chair/wheelchair and to toilet. For these items, the independence levels were proportionally associated with FIM-motor scores. For eating, higher FIM-motor scores (> 60) were associated with modified independence and lower FIM-motor scores (< 40) correlated with attainment of supervision/set-up levels. For dressing lower body, greater independence was apparent when FIM-motor scores were higher (> 60).
   Conclusion: For single FIM (TM) items, relative difficulty was comparable with results from previous literatures using Rasch analyses. Moreover, our results revealed that relative difficulty for single items varied greatly between independence levels. With regard to disability task targets, probability of independence evaluated from logistic modelling is an aid to efficient rehabilitation scheduling.

TI Identifying patients at high risk of emergency hospital admissions: a
   logistic regression analysis
SO JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID POPULATION; PEOPLE; LONDON; CARE
AB Objective To use routine data to identify patients at high risk of future emergency hospital admissions.
   Design Descriptive analysis of inpatient hospital episode statistics. Predictive model developed using multiple logistic regression.
   Setting National Health Service hospital trusts in England.
   Participants All patients with an emergency admission to an NHS hospital between 1 April 2000 and 31 March 2001.
   Main outcome measures 'High-impact users' were defined as patients who had at least one emergency inpatient admission and who then went on to have at least two further emergency hospital admissions in the 12 months following the start date of that index admission.
   Results 2 895 234 patients were admitted as emergencies in 2000/2001, of whom 147 725 (5.1%) did not survive their first spell. Of the 2 747 509 surviving patients, 269 686 (9.8%) subsequently had at least two or more emergency admissions within 365 days of the index date of admission. A further 236 779 (8.6%) died during this period. Risk factors for becoming a high-impact user included the number of emergencies in the 36 months before index spell, comorbidity, age, an admission for an ambulatory care sensitive condition, ethnicity, area-level socioeconomic data, local admission rates, the number of episodes in the index spell, sex and the source of admission. The predictive model based on all emergency admissions produced a receiver operating characteristic curve score of 0.72.
   Conclusions Routine hospital episode statistics can be used to identify patients who are at high risk of suffering future multiple emergency hospital admissions. The potential cost savings in preventing a proportion of these subsequent admissions need to be compared with the costs of case management of these patients.

AB Objectives. To determine events during follow-up of patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD) and the specific experience cardiologists need for trouble-shooting.
   Design. Prospective evaluation of all patient visits in an outpatient clinic.
   Setting. University hospital, single centre performing ICD controls in a region of 1.5 Mio inhabitants.
   Subjects. A total of 351 patients with 1118 consecutive visits during 14 months.
   Interventions. Classification of events according to predefined training levels.
   Main outcome measurements. Skill levels A: simple visit, e.g. for switching the device 'off'. B: normal visit, no further measures taken (no device reprogramming), even though the patient might have experienced ICD interventions. C: complex visit, electrophysiologist actively involved. Correlation of these levels with timing (routine, emergency on/off office hours) and reason of visits.
   Results. Seventy-six per cent of visits were scheduled routine visits, 5% performed within 24 h because of shocks, 19% performed for other reasons (shock tests; switching the device 'off/on'; reported dizziness, syncope, palpitations without ICD interventions). Required skill levels were A in 44 (4%), B in 796 (71%) and C in 278 (25%) visits. Emergency visits were more often classified as level C (60%) than regular visits (20%), Skill level C was more often encountered during emergency (30%) than during regular visits (6%) (both P = 0.001).
   Conclusions. Our study suggests that for standard follow-up in patients without obvious problems, a cardiologist might be sufficient, whereas presentations due to/with clinical problems most likely will need the expertise of an electrophysiologist.

   P16; PREDISPOSITION; SUSCEPTIBILITY; PREVALENCE; STATEMENT
AB Background: Heritable alterations in CDKN2A account for a subset of familial melanoma cases although no robust method exists to identify those at risk of being a mutation carrier.
   Methods: We set out to construct a model for estimating CDKN2A mutation carrier probability using a cohort of 116 consecutive familial cutaneous melanoma patients evaluated at Massachusetts General Hospital Pigmented Lesion Center between April 2001 and September 2004. Germline CDKN2A and CDK4 status on the familial melanoma cases and clinical features associated with mutational status were then used to build a multiple logistic regression model to predict carrier probability and performance of model on external validation.
   Results: From the 116 kindreds prone to melanoma in the Boston area, 13 CDKN2A mutation carriers were identified and 12 were subsequently used in the modeling. Proband age at diagnosis, number of proband primaries, and number of additional family primaries were most closely associated with germline mutations. The estimated probability of the proband being a mutation carrier based on the logistic regression model (MELPREDICT) is given by e(L)/1+e(L) where L = 1.99+[0.926(no. of proband primaries)]+[0.74x(no.of additional family primaries)]-[2.11xIn((age))]. The mean estimated probabilities for subjects in the Boston dataset were 55.4% and 5.1% for the mutation carriers and non-carriers respectively. In a receiver operator characteristic analysis, the area under the curve was 0.881 (95% confidence interval 0.739 to 1.000) for the Boston model set (n = 116) and 0.803 (0.729 to 0.877) for an external Toronto hereditary melanoma cohort (n = 143).
   Conclusions: These results represent the first-iteration logistic regression model to approximate CDKN2A carrier probability. Validation of this model with an external dataset revealed relatively robust performance.

AB Purpose: We examined whether the change of the logistic organ dysfunction score (LOD) between the first and the fourth day in the intensive care unit (ICU) could be predictive of death in the ICU. The LOD could then be used to help make decisions concerning therapeutic limitations (TL).
   Methods: One hundred fifty-four patients were included. Exclusion criteria were: discharge from the ICU or TL before the 72(nd) hr. Ninety-three patients remained for evaluation. The LOD was calculated on the day of admission (LODI) and between the 72(nd) and 96(th) hr (LOD4). The Delta LOD = LOD4 - LOD1 index was calculated for survivors and non-survivors; sensitivity, specificity; positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated.
   Results: Sixteen patients died in the ICU, they had a higher Delta LOD (0 vs -2; P = 0.0046) than the survivors. After logistic regression, a high Delta LOD was associated with a higher risk of death in the ICU independent of the initial severity of disease. The PPV concerning death in the ICU was 0.66 for a Delta LOD >= 4 cut-off. The NPV was 0.89 for a cut-off of >= 1.
   Conclusion: Delta LOD appears to be a predictor of death in the ICU, independent of the initial severity of disease. The PPV is not high enough to assist with making individual TL decisions. The NPV can help to identify patients at low risk of death. The Delta LOD deserves to be evaluated in a population exhibiting greater severity of disease.

TI The use of logistic regression to enhance risk assessment and decision
   making by mental health administrators
SO JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES & RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID CARE
AB Development of policies and procedures to contend with the risks presented by elopement, aggression, and suicidal behaviors are long-standing challenges for mental health administrators. Guidance in making such judgments can be obtained through the use of a multivariate statistical technique known as logistic regression. This procedure can be used to develop a predictive equation that is mathematically formulated to use the best combination of predictors, rather that? considering just one factor at a time. This paper presents an overview of logistic regression and its utility in mental health administrative decision making. A case example of its application is presented using data on elopements from Missouri's long-term state psychiatric hospitals. Ultimately, the use of statistical prediction analyses tempered with differential qualitative weighting of classification errors can augment decision-making processes in a manner that provides guidance and flexibility while wrestling with the complex problem of risk assessment and decision making.

AB Observational studies often provide the only available information about treatment effects. Control of confounding, however, remains challenging. The authors compared five methods for evaluating the effect of tissue plasminogen activator on death among 6,269 ischemic stroke patients registered in a German stroke registry: multivariable logistic regression, propensity score-matched analysis, regression adjustment with the propensity score, and two propensity score-based weighted methods-one estimating the treatment effect in the entire study population (inverse-probability-of-treatment weights), another in the treated population (standardized-mortality-ratio weights). Between 2000 and 2001, 212 patients received tissue plasminogen activator. The crude odds ratio between tissue plasminogen activator and death was 3.35 (95% confidence interval: 2.28, 4.91). The adjusted odds ratio depended strongly on the adjustment method, ranging from 1.11 (95% confidence interval: 0.67, 1.84) for the standardized-mortality-ratio weighted to 10.77 (95% confidence interval: 2.47, 47.04) for the inverse-probability-of-treatment-weighted analysis. For treated patients with a low propensity score, risks of dying were high. Exclusion of patients with a propensity score of <5% yielded comparable odds ratios of approximately 1 for all methods. High levels of nonuniform treatment effect render summary estimates very sensitive to the weighting system explicit or implicit in an adjustment technique. Researchers need to be clear about the population for which an overall treatment estimate is most suitable.

AB Background: Dengue fever is a frequent cause of admission to hospital in South East Asia, however many of the clinical characteristics and abnormalities on laboratory investigations at presentation are found in other common infections.
   Objectives: To describe the clinical and laboratory features of dengue fever and other common febrile illnesses in Singapore.
   Study design: We performed a prospective study of consecutive adult admissions to an infectious diseases hospital. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify symptoms, physical signs and laboratory features that differentiated dengue fever from other febrile illnesses within the first 2 days of admission.
   Results: Of the 381 patients studied, 148 had serologically confirmed den-Lie fever. Most of these had uncomplicated dengue fever, and only 9% had dengue haemorrhagic fever. A model based on clinical features alone (including a variety of cutaneous signs, pulse rate and the presence of pharyngeal injection) was able to differentiate dengue fever front other infections with a sensitivity of 74% and specificity of 79%. A model based on clinical features (rash) and laboratory parameters (white cell count, haemoglobin, prothrombin time, creatinine and bilirubin levels), achieved a sensitivity of 84% and specificity of 85%.
   Conclusions: A combination of simple clinical and laboratory parameters are potentially able to predict dengue fever with a high level of accuracy in adults presenting to hospital with febrile illnesses in Singapore. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND. Differentiating Lyme meningitis (LM) from other forms of aseptic meningitis (AM) in children is a common diagnostic dilemma in Lyme disease endemic regions. Prior studies have compared clinical characteristics of patients with LM versus patients with documented enteroviral infections. No large studies have compared patients with LM to all patients presenting with AM and attempted to define a clinical prediction model.
   OBJECTIVE. To create a statistical model to predict LM versus AM in children based on history, physical, and laboratory findings during the initial presentation of meningitis.
   METHODS. Children older than 2 years presenting to the Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children between October 1999 and September 2004 were identified if both Lyme serology and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were collected during the same hospital encounter. Patients were considered to have Lyme disease only if they met Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria (documented erythema migrans and/or positive Lyme serology). Patients were eligible for study inclusion if they had documented meningitis (CSF white blood cell count: > 8 per mm(3)). Retrospective chart review abstracted duration of headache and cranial neuritis (papilledema or cranial nerve palsy) on physical examination and percent CSF mononuclear cells. Using logistic-regression analysis, the type of meningitis (LM versus AM) was simultaneously regressed on these 3 variables. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test was performed and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was calculated.
   RESULTS. A total of 175 children with meningitis were included in the final statistical model. Logistic-regression analysis included 27 patients with LM and 148 patients classified as having AM. Duration of headache, cranial neuritis, and percent CSF mononuclear cells independently predicted LM. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test revealed a good fit for the model, and the Nagelkerke R-2 effect size demonstrated good predictive efficacy. Odds ratios based on the logistic-regression results were calculated for these variables. The final model was transformed into a clinical prediction model that allows practitioners to calculate the probability of a child having LM.
   CONCLUSIONS. Longer duration of headache, presence of cranial neuritis, and predominance of CSF mononuclear cells are predictive of LM in children presenting with meningitis in a Lyme disease-endemic region. The clinical prediction model can help guide the clinician about the need for parenteral antibiotics while awaiting serology results.

AB An efficient knowledge sharing between multiple participating parties is required to provide for situation awareness and consequently to manage any networked organization. Thereby, it is necessary that the right knowledge from distributed sources is integrated and transferred to the right person within the right context at the right time to the right purpose. The aggregate of these interrelated activities is referred to as knowledge logistics (KL). The paper presents an approach that implements KL for an intelligent decision support. The approach assumes an ontological knowledge representation model based on the paradigm of object-oriented constraint networks. This makes it possible to perform problem solving by directly extracting slices of the common ontology and putting them into constraint solvers such as ILOG. Humanitarian relief operations are considered here as one of the approach applications what is illustrated via a case study of on-the-fly portable hospital configuration.

AB Feedforward neural networks are often used in a similar manner as logistic regression models; that is, to estimate the probability of the occurrence of an event. In this paper, a probabilistic model is developed for the purpose of estimating the probability that a patient who has been admitted to the hospital with a medical back diagnosis will be released after only a short stay or will remain hospitalized for a longer period of time. As the purpose of the analysis is to determine if hospital characteristics influence the decision to retain a patient, the inputs to this model are a set of demographic variables that describe the various hospitals. The output is the probability of either a short or long term hospital stay. In order to compare the ability of each method to model the data, a hypothesis test is performed to test for an improvement resulting from the use of the neural network model.

AB The aim of our study was to generate predictive model, which would allow to estimate the influence of analyzed parameters on predictive accuracy of differential diagnosis of adnexal masses and to evaluate prospectively diagnostic efficacy of the statistic model in the new set of patients. A total of 686 women diagnosed and surgically treated in the Gynecological and Obstetrical Teaching Hospital of University of Medical Sciences in Poznan, Poland, were recruited into the study. Preoperative diagnostics included gynecological examination, ultrasonographic evaluation, tumor Doppler blood flow analysis, and serum levels of CA125 and TPS. In order to find the best combination of features and to calculate the individual probability of the malignancy, stepwise logistic regression analysis with quasi-Newton estimation was applied. The essential part of the best prognostic model, described by foregoing variables, is as follows:
   z = -6.005 + 0.058 x 1.74 x septa +1.317 x tumour localization +1.185 x ascites + 2.28 solid element + 2.429 x vessels localization -2.386 x PI +0.084 x MEDV
   The highest sensitivity and specificity for the obtained model were 87.84% and 93.74%, respectively. Prognostic model, constructed with the use of logistic regression analysis, is characterized by higher sensitivity and specificity than individually applied diagnostic tests. Prospective evaluation of this model application in a larger group of patients with adnexal masses will enable precise assessment of its objective clinical usefulness.

AB The Omagh bombing in August 1998 produced many of the problems documented in other major incidents. An initial imbalance between the demand and supply of clinical resources at the local hospital, poor information due to telecommunication problems, the need to triage victims and the need to transport the most severely injured significant distances were the most serious issues. The Royal Group Hospitals Trust (RGHT) received 30 severely injured secondary transfers over a 5-hour period, which stressed the hospital's systems even with the presence of extra staff that arrived voluntarily before the hospital's major incident plan was activated. Many patients were transferred to the RGHT by helicopter, but much of the time the gained advantage was lost due to lack of a helipad within the RGHT site. Identifying patients and tracking them through the hospital system was problematic. While the major incident plan ensured that communication with the relatives and the media was effective and timely, communication between the key clinical and managerial staff was hampered by the need to be mobile and by the limitations of the internal telephone system. The use of mobile anaesthetic teams helped maintain the flow of patients between the Emergency Department and radiology, operating theatres or the intensive care unit (ICU). The mobile anaesthetic teams were also responsible for efficient and timely resupply of the Emergency Department, which worked well. In the days that followed many victims required further surgical procedures. Coordination of the multidisciplinary teams required for many of these procedures was difficult. Although only seven patients required admission to adult general intensive care, no ICU beds were available for other admissions over the following 5 days. A total of 165 days of adult ICU treatment were required for the victims of the bombing.

AB A simple reproducible and sensitive prognostic trauma tool. is still needed. In this article we have introduced modified GCS motor response (MGMR) and evaluated the performance of logistic models based on this variable.
   The records of 8452 trauma patients admitted to major hospitals of Tehran from 1999 to 2000 were analysed. 7226 records with known outcome were included in our study.
   Logistic models based on outcome (death versus survival) as a dependent variable and Injury Severity Score (ISS), Revised Trauma Score (RTS), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), GCS motor component (GMR) and MGMR (following command [=2], movement but not following [=1] command and without movement [=0]) were compared based on their accuracy and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve.
   The accuracy of the Trauma and Injury Severity Score (TRISS), RTS, GCS, GMR and MGMR models were almost the same. Considering both the area under the ROC curve and accuracy, the age included MGMR model was also comparable with other age included models (RTS + age, GCS + age, GMR + age).
   We concluded that although in some situations we need more sophisticated models, should our results be reproducible in other populations, MGMR (with or without age added) model may be of considerable practical value. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID NEW-YORK-STATE; VOLUME; ISSUES; CARE
AB Background: In recent years, several studies in the medical and health service research literature have advocated the use of hierarchical statistical models (multilevel models or random-effects models) to analyze data that are nested (eg, patients nested within hospitals). However, these models are computer-intensive and complicated to perform. There is virtually nothing in the literature that compares the results of standard logistic regression to those of hierarchical logistic models in predicting future provider performance.
   Objective: We sought to compare the ability of standard logistic regression relative to hierarchical modeling in predicting risk-adjusted hospital mortality rates for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery in New York State.
   Design, Setting and Patients: New York State CABG Registry data from 1994 to 1999 were used to relate statistical predictions from a given year to hospital performance 2 years hence.
   Main Outcome Measures: Predicted and observed hospital mortality rates 2 years hence were compared using root mean square errors, the mean absolute difference, and the number of hospitals whose predicted mortality rate data was within a 95% confidence interval around the observed mortality rate.
   Results: In these data, standard logistic regression performed similarly to hierarchical models, both with and without a second level covariate Differences in the criteria used for comparison were minimal, and when the differences could be statistically tested no significant differences were identified.
   Conclusions: It is instructive to compare the predictive abilities of alternative statistical models in the process of assessing their relative performance on a specific database and application.

AB When modeling or redesigning a process, the knowledge-management perspective is seldomly used. Using the knowledge categorization developed by van Heusden and Jorna, we propose a knowledge.-management perspective to provide a strategy for modeling and redesigning a business process. As an illustration of our approach, we use hospital data of multidisciplinary patients. This specific group of patients requires the involvement of different specialisms for their medical treatment that leads to more efforts regarding the coordination of care for these patients. In order to increase the care efficiency, knowledge that supports the reorganization of care for multidisciplinary patients should be provided. We use the above-mentioned knowledge-management perspective for creating new multidisciplinary units, in which different specialisms coordinate the treatment of specific groups of patients.

AB To aid in understanding how best to respond to a bioterror anthrax attack, we analyze a system of differential equations that includes an atmospheric release model, a spatial array of biosensors, a dose-response model, a disease progression model, and a set of spatially distributed tandem queues for distributing antibiotics and providing hospital care. We derive approximate closed-form expressions for the number of deaths as a function of key parameters and management levers, including the size of the attack, the time at which the attack is detected via symptomatic patients, the number of days to distribute antibiotics, the efficacy (both for treatment and prevention) of antibiotics, the prophylactic antibiotic distribution strategy, the prioritization of the antibiotics queue, and the detection limit, deployment density and delay time of biosensors.

SO CRITICAL CARE
LA English

ID INTENSIVE-CARE-UNIT; MODELS; EPIDEMIOLOGY; MORTALITY
AB Introduction Neural networks are new methodological tools based on nonlinear models. They appear to be better at prediction and classification in biological systems than do traditional strategies such as logistic regression. This paper provides a practical example that contrasts both approaches within the setting of suspected sepsis in the emergency room.
   Methods The study population comprised patients with suspected bacterial infection as their main diagnosis for admission to the emergency room at two University-based hospitals. Mortality within the first 28 days from admission was predicted using logistic regression with the following variables: age, immunosuppressive systemic disease, general systemic disease, Shock Index, temperature, respiratory rate, Glasgow Coma Scale score, leucocyte counts, platelet counts and creatinine. Also, with the same input and output variables, a probabilistic neural network was trained with an adaptive genetic algorithm. The network had three neurone layers: 10 neurones in the input layer, 368 in the hidden layer and two in the output layer. Calibration was measured using the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test and discrimination was determined using receiver operating characteristic curves.
   Results A total of 533 patients were recruited and overall 28-day mortality was 19%. The factors chosen by logistic regression (with their score in parentheses) were as follows: immunosuppressive systemic disease or general systemic disease (2), respiratory rate 24-33 breaths/min (1), respiratory rate >= 34 breaths/min (3), Glasgow Come Scale score <= 12 (3), Shock Index >= 1.5 (2) and temperature <38 degrees C (2). The network included all variables and there were no significant differences in predictive ability between the approaches. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves were 0.7517 and 0.8782 for the logistic model and the neural network, respectively (P = 0.037).
   Conclusion A predictive model would be an extremely useful tool in the setting of suspected sepsis in the emergency room. It could serve both as a guideline in medical decision-making and as a simple way to select or stratify patients in clinical research. Our proposed model and the specific development method - either logistic regression or neural networks - must be evaluated and validated in an independent population.

AB At 07: 39 on 11 March 2004, 10 terrorist bomb explosions occurred almost simultaneously in four commuter trains in Madrid, Spain, killing 177 people instantly and injuring more than 2000. There were 14 subsequent in-hospital deaths, bringing the ultimate death toll to 191. This report describes the organization of clinical management and patterns of injuries in casualties who were taken to the closest hospital, with an emphasis on the critically ill. A total of 312 patients were taken to the hospital and 91 patients were hospitalized, of whom 89 (28.5%) remained in hospital for longer than 24 hours. Sixty-two patients had only superficial bruises or emotional shock, but the remaining 250 patients had more severe injuries. Data on 243 of these 250 patients form the basis of this report. Tympanic perforation occurred in 41% of 243 victims with moderate- to- severe trauma, chest injuries in 40%, shrapnel wounds in 36%, fractures in 18%, first-degree or second-degree burns in 18%, eye lesions in 18%, head trauma in 12% and abdominal injuries in 5%. Between 08: 00 and 17: 00, 34 surgical interventions were performed in 32 patients. Twenty-nine casualties ( 12% of the total, or 32.5% of those hospitalized) were deemed to be in a critical condition, and two of these died within minutes of arrival. The other 27 survived to admission to intensive care units, and three of them died, bringing the critical mortality rate to 17.2% (5/29). The mean Injury Severity Score and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores for critically ill patients were 34 and 23, respectively. Among these critically ill patients, soft tissue and musculoskeletal injuries predominated in 85% of cases, ear blast injury was identified in 67% and blast lung injury was present in 63%. Fifty-two per cent suffered head trauma. Over-triage to the closest hospital probably occurred, and the time of the blasts proved to be crucial to the the adequacy of the medical and surgical response. The number of blast lung injuries seen is probably the largest reported by a single institution, and the critical mortality rate was reasonably low.

AB The logistic regression model is frequently used in epidemiologic studies, yielding odds ratio or relative risk interpretations. Inspired by the theory of linear normal models, the logistic regression model has been extended to allow for correlated responses by introducing random effects. However, the model does not inherit the interpretational features of the normal model. In this paper, the authors argue that the existing measures are unsatisfactory (and some of them are even improper) when quantifying results from multilevel logistic regression analyses. The authors suggest a measure of heterogeneity, the median odds ratio, that quantifies cluster heterogeneity and facilitates a direct comparison between covariate effects and the magnitude of heterogeneity in terms of well-known odds ratios. Quantifying cluster-level covariates in a meaningful way is a challenge in multilevel logistic regression. For this purpose, the authors propose an odds ratio measure, the interval odds ratio, that takes these difficulties into account. The authors demonstrate the two measures by investigating heterogeneity between neighborhoods and effects of neighborhood-level covariates in two examples-public physician visits and ischemic heart disease hospitalizations-using 1999 data on 11,312 men aged 45-85 years in Malmo, Sweden.

AB A knowledge management perspective is rarely used to model a process. Using the cognitive perspective on knowledge management in which we start our analysis with events and knowledge (bottom-up) instead of with processes and units (top-down), we propose a new approach for redesigning hospital logistic processes. To increase the care efficiency of multi-disciplinary patients, tailored knowledge in content and type that supports the reorganization of care should be provided. We discuss the advantages of several techniques in providing robust knowledge about the logistic hospital process by employing electronic patient records (EPR's) and diagnosis treatment combinations (DTC's).

AB Objectives: The technology of grid services is developing fast. This paper presents an approach to the implementation of an intelligent grid service that configures a hospital taking advantage of the knowledge logistics idea.
   Methods: The presented approach is based on synergistic integration of knowledge acquired from distributed sources in order to obtain new or complement insufficient knowledge. Presented approach uses ontologies and the formalism of object-oriented constraint networks for knowledge representation and applies ILOG to constraint-based problem solving.
   Results: The application of the approach is illustrated via a decision support system for a fictitious case study of a hospital configuration in the Binni region. The system showed the ability to produce interrelated solutions for subtasks of the hospital configuration task based on the built ontology and input parameters. Besides, such preferences as cost or time minimization are also considered by the implemented fuzzy logic module that finds a feasible solution.
   Conclusions: KL would benefit from the grid, and particularly from the concept of a semantic grid. The scalable architecture of the approach enables its extension with regard to knowledge/information sources number and, thereby, with regard to factors taken into account during complex problem solving. Utilizing ontologies allows integration of the approach into existing processes and facilitates knowledge sharing with similar systems. Application of constraint networks allows rapid problem manipulation and usage of such existing efficient technologies as ILOG.

AB Objective: This study was undertaken to develop a simple and robust method for predicting? risk of cesarean section.
   Study design: Retrospective cohort study of singleton births at term between 1992 and 1999 in 22 Scottish maternity hospitals among primigravid women induced with prostaglandin. The risk 22 emergency cesarean section was modeled by using multivariate logistic regression in a development sample (n = 14,968). The output of this model was converted into adjusted likelihood ratios by using a novel method and tested in a validation sample (n = 12:638)
   Results: Maternal age, height, gestational age, and fetal sex were all predictive of the risk of emergency cesarean section after prostaglandin induction of labor (all P < .001). The area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve in the development group was 0.677. The derived Bayesian model was comparably predictive of cesarean section risk in the validation sample: ROC of 0.673 (95% Cl 0.662-0.684). Arnong the 994 women (8%) with a predicted cesarean section risk of more than 40%, the expected proportion was 48.2% and the observed proportion was 47.2 %. Arriong the 1439 (11.4%) with a predicted cesarean risk of less than 10% the expected proportion was 7.9% and the actual proportion 8.6%.
   Conclusion: Women at low or high risk of cesarean section after prostaglandin induction of labor can be identified with the use a novel combination of logistic regression and Bayesian modeling. The method is simple, robust, and may be generally applicable for clinical estimation of risk. &COPY; 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: Automated variable selection methods are frequently used to determine the independent predictors of an outcome. The objective of this study was to determine the reproducibility of logistic regression models developed using automated variable selection methods.
   Study Design and Setting: An initial set of 29 candidate variables were considered for predicting mortality after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We drew 1,000 bootstrap samples from a dataset consisting of 4,911 patients admitted to hospital with an AMI. Using each bootstrap sample, logistic regression models predicting 30-day mortality were obtained using backward elimination, forward selection, and stepwise selection. The agreement between the different model selection methods and the agreement across the 1,000 bootstrap samples were compared.
   Results: Using 1,000 bootstrap samples, backward elimination identified 940 unique models for predicting mortality. Similar results were obtained for forward and stepwise selection. Three variables were identified as independent predictors of mortality among all bootstrap samples. Over half the candidate prognostic variables were identified as independent predictors in less than half of the bootstrap samples.
   Conclusion: Automated variable selection methods result in models that are unstable and not reproducible. The variables selected as independent predictors are sensitive to random fluctuations in the data. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB PURPOSE: Describe and compare the characteristics of artificial neural networks and logistic regression to develop prediction models in epidemiological research.
   METHODS: The sample included 3708 persons with hip fracture from 46 different states included in the Uniform Data System for Medical Rehabilitation. Mean age was 75.5 years (sd = 14.2), 73.7% of patients were female, and 82% were non-Hispanic white. Average length of stay was 17.0 days (sd = 10.6). The primary outcome measure was living setting (at home vs. not at home) at 80 to 180 days after discharge.
   RESULTS: Statistically significant variables (p < .05) in the logistic model included follow-up therapy, sphincter control, self-care ability, marital status, age, and length of stay. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves were 0.67 for logistic regression and 0.73 for neural network analysis. Calibration curves indicated a slightly better fit for the neural network model.
   CONCLUSIONS: Follow-up therapy and independent bowel and/or bladder function were strong predictors of living at home up to 6 months after hospitalization for hip fracture. No practical differences were found between the predictive ability of logistic regression and neural network analysis in this sample. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background. The purpose of this study was to identify clinical and biochemical variables that predict the outcome of upper/lower endoscopy in outpatients with iron deficiency anemia and to determine which endoscopic procedure should be performed first.
   Methods: Ninety-eight patients (74 women, 24 men; mean age 55 years) with iron deficiency anemia referred from the hematology department were interviewed and responded to a questionnaire that included clinical and biochemical variables, and underwent EGD (with biopsies) and colonoscopy. The endoscopic findings were recorded as presence/absence of GI cancer, upper/lower GI tract lesions and bleeding/non-bleeding-associated GI lesions. A multiple logistic regression analysis was applied to identify variables significantly related with the outcome of the investigations. Multiple analyses were performed so that a Bonferroni correction for multiple testing removed significance except where p < 0.01.
   Results: A likely cause of iron deficiency anemia was found in 86.7% of patients. The risk factors for GI malignancies were: male gender (OR 7.5: 95% Cl[1.7, 31.9]; p < 0.01), advanced age (OR 1.1/y: 95% Cl[l, 1.2]; p < 0.01), and lower mean corpuscular volume (OR 1.1/unit: 95% Cl[l 9 1.2]; p < 0.002). The risk factors for bleeding-related diseases were the following: greater age (OR 1.1/y: 95% Cl[1.1, 1.2]; p < 0.001), absence of lower-GI tract symptoms (OR 4.7: 95% Cl[1.3, 16.6]; p < 0.05), and a positive fecal occult blood test (OR 4.1: 95% Cl[1.2, 14.3]; p < 0.05). The risk factors for nonbleeding-related GI tract diseases were the following: negative fecal occult blood test (OR 4.5: 95% Cl[1.16, 20]; p < 0.05) and higher Hb level (OR 1.4/unit: 95% Cl[1.1, 1.8]; p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: For non-hospitalized patients with iron deficiency anemia, colonoscopy should be the initial investigation in those greater than 50 years of age, particularly men, and those without upper-GI tract symptoms and with lower values for mean corpuscular volume and Hb. EGD should be performed first in younger patients, particularly those with a mild decrease in Hb and a negative fecal occult blood test.

AB Background: In Japan, the standard treatment policy for all potentially curable patients with gastric cancer is radical resection including extensive lymphadenectomy. This treatment strategy has been used for both early and advanced gastric cancers, and substantial increases in survival time have been reported. In advanced gastric cancer, lymphatic spread is reported to be one of the most relevant prognostic factors for gastric cancer resected for cure. The purpose of this study was to determine the factors affecting lymph node involvement and to establish guidelines for the extent of lymph node dissection most appropriate for the treatment of gastric cancer. Methods: The clinicopathological features of 926 patients with gastric cancer were reviewed. Information on the clinicopathological features was obtained from the database of gastric cancer at the Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Sendai National Hospital. Univariate and multivariate analyses of data for patients with gastric cancer tumors were performed to evaluate the prognostic significance of clinicopathological features. The independent risk factors influencing lymph node metastasis were determined by multiple logistic regression analysis. Results: The following clinicopathologic factors were found to be correlated with prognosis of gastric cancer: (1) macroscopic type, (2) depth of invasion, (3) cancer-stromal relationship, (4) histological growth pattern, (5) lymph node involvement, (6) lymphatic invasion, (7) vascular invasion and (8) tumor site. However, a multivariate analysis revealed that macroscopic type, depth of invasion, lymph node involvement and tumor site are independent risk factors for the prognosis of gastric cancer patients. Among these factors, the prognosis of patients with gastric cancer was most strongly influenced by lymph node involvement (odds ratio, 4.632). According to a multiple logistic regression model, depth of cancer invasion and lymphatic invasion was significantly correlated with lymph node metastases. Conclusions: Lymph node involvement has the strongest influence on the prognosis of gastric cancer. Among the clinicopathological factors, depth of invasion and microscopically lymphatic invasion are important factors in predicting lymph node metastases. Thus, the ability to perform gastrectomy with dissection of lymph nodes is a basic requirement for gastric cancer surgeons.

AB Introduction: The impact of the immediate in-hospital post-resuscitation care after out-hospital cardiac arrest is not well known. Based on treatment variables and laboratory findings a multiple logistic regression model was created for the prediction of survival at 6 months from the event. Materials and methods: A retrospective study of the hospital charts of patients successfully resuscitated and treated in one of three community hospitals from 1998 to 2000. In addition to several pre-hospital variables, the mean 72 h values of clinical features such as blood pressure, blood glucose concentration and initiated treatment used, were included in a forward multiple logistic regression model predicting survival at 6 months from the event. Results: The charts of 98 out of a total of 102 patients were sufficiently complete and included in the analysis. Variables independently associated with survival were age, delay before a return of spontaneous circulation, mean blood glucose and serum potassium, and the use of beta-blocking agents during post-resuscitation care. When those patients who were assigned a 'do not attempt to resuscitate' (DNAR) order during the first 72 h of treatment were excluded from the analysis blood glucose, blood potassium and the use beta-blocking agents remained independently associated with survival. Conclusion: This study suggests that in-hospital factors are associated with survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The mean blood glucose and serum potassium during the first 72 h of treatment and the use of beta-blocking agents were significantly and independently associated with survival.

AB Aim. The aim of this study was to investigate the relative importance of key factors affecting the likelihood of hospital acquired pressure ulcers, thus offering the groundwork for the development of an empirically-based risk assessment scale. It also evaluated the predictive performance of the underlying empirical model and compared its classification ability with the empirically observed ability of the Waterlow risk assessment scale.
   Background. Pressure ulcers impose a significant burden on patients and carers and demand substantial resources from the health care system. There is, however, a lack of systematic empirical research on which to base the development of risk assessment measurement tools.
   Methods. Multivariate statistical methods were applied to data derived from the records of a cross-sectional sample of around 500 randomly selected inpatient episodes drawn from the population of admissions to a single unit in a large acute hospital during a 2-year period ( October 1996 to September 1998). Double-checking of a randomly selected 25% sample of the original records and careful screening out of records with incomplete information or inconsistent values was carried out to ensure a high quality sample. Logit analysis was used to investigate the relative contribution of risk factors, such as continence, skin condition, mobility and inter-hospital transfer to the risk of hospital-acquired pressure ulcer occurrence, whilst cross-validation techniques were employed to check the predictive performance of the model.
   Results. The results suggest that a simplified version of the Waterlow risk assessment tool has satisfactory predictive ability and the potential for further development.
   Conclusions. Two main conclusions emerged from this study. First, it is both feasible and worthwhile to pursue improvement in the development of risk assessment tools using statistical methods. Second, locally-determined risk factors will need to be incorporated into the construction of future risk assessment scales.

AB Background Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome is more frequent than death in paediatric intensive care units. Estimation of the severity of this syndrome could be a useful additional outcome measure in clinical trials in such units. We aimed to validate the paediatric logistic organ dysfunction (PELOID) score and estimate its validity when recorded daily (dPELOD).
   Methods We did a prospective, observational, multicentre cohort study in seven multidisciplinary, tertiary-care paediatric intensive care units of university-affiliated hospitals (two French, three Canadian, and two Swiss). We included 1806 consecutive patients (median age 24 months; IQR 5-90). PELOD score includes six organ dysfunctions and 12 variables and was recorded daily. For each variable, the most abnormal value each day and during the whole stay were used in calculating the dPELOD and PELOD scores, respectively. Outcome was vital status at discharge. We used Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit tests to evaluate calibration and areas under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to estimate discrimination.
   Findings 370 (21%) patients had no organ dysfunction, 471 (26%) had one, 457 (25%) had two, and 508 (28%) had three or more. Case fatality rate was 6.4% (115 deaths). PELOD score was significantly higher in non-survivors (mean 31.0 [SE 1.2]) than survivors (9.4 [0.2]; p<0.0001). Calibration (p=0.54) and discrimination (AUC=0.91, SE=0.01) of PELOD and dPELOD (p&GE;0.39; AUC&GE;0.79) scores were good.
   Interpretation PELOD and dPELOD scores are valid outcome measures of the severity of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome in paediatric intensive care units; their use should significantly reduce the sample size required to complete clinical trials in critically ill children.

AB Background Data. in health research are frequently structured, hierarchically. For example, data, may consist of patients treated by physicians who in turn practice in hospitals. Traditional statistical techniques ignore the possible correlation of outcomes within a given practice or hospital. Furthermore, imputing characteristics measured at higher levels of, the hierarchy to the patient-level artificially inflates the amount of available information on the effect of higher-level characteristics on outcomes.
   Methods Conventional logistic regression models and multilevel logistic regression models were fit to a cross-sectional cohort of patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction. The statistical significance of the effect of patient, physician, and hospital characteristics on patient outcomes was compared between the 2 modeling strategies.
   Results The 2 analytic strategies agreed well on the effect of patient characteristics on outcomes. According to the traditional analysis, teaching status was statistically significantly associated with 5 of the 9 outcomes, whereas the multilevel models did not find a statistically significant association between teaching status and any patient outcomes. Similarly, the traditional and multilevel models disagreed on the statistical significance of the effect of being treated at a revascularization hospital and 3 patient outcomes.
   Conclusions in comparing the resultant models, we see that false inferences can be drawn by ignoring the structure of the data. Conventional logistic regression tended to increase the statistical significance for. the effects of variables measured at the hospital-level compared to the level of significance indicated by the multilevel model.

AB Objectives: In this paper three statistical methods [logistic regression, classification and regression tree (CART), and fuzzy inference] for the prediction of lymph node metastasis on carcinoma of the tongue are compared. Methods: A retrospective collection of data in 75 patients treated for tongue cancer was carried out at the Clinic and Policlinic for Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at the University Hospital of Freiburg in Germany between January 1990 and December 1999; biopsy material was used for laboratory evaluations. Statistical methods for the prediction of lymph node metastasis were compared using ROC curves and occuracy rates. Results: All three methods show similar results for the prediction of lymph node metastasis with slightly superior results for fuzzy inference and CART. A great overlap is apparent in the ROC curves. The best result observed for fuzzy inference and CART was a sensitivity of 79.2% [95% confidence interval: (57.8%; 92.9%)] and a specificity of 86.3% (73.7%; 94.3%); the best result for predictions based on logistic regression was a sensitivity of 66.% (44.7%; 84.4%) and a specificity of 80.4% (66.9%; 90.2%). Accuracy rates of fuzzy method and CART were higher [accuracy rate fuzzy method and CART: 84% (73.7%; 91.4%), for logistic regression method: 73.3%, 95%CI: (61.9%; 82.9%)].
   Conclusions: From a clinical point of view, the predictive ability of the three methods is not sufficiently large to justify use of these methods in daily practice. Other factors probably on the molecular level are needed for prediction of lymph node metastasis.

ID CARE
AB Present-day healthcare witnesses a growing demand for coordination of patient care. Coordination is needed especially in those cases in which hospitals have structured healthcare into specialty-oriented units, while a substantial portion of patient care is not limited to single units. From a logistic point of view, this multi-disciplinary patient care creates a tension between controlling the hospital's units, and the need for a control of the patient flow between units. A possible solution is the creation of new units in which different specialties work together for specific groups of patients. A first step in this solution is to identify the salient patient groups in need of multi-disciplinary care. Grouping techniques seem to offer a solution. However, most grouping approaches in medicine are driven by a search for pathophysiological homogeneity. In this paper, we present an alternative logistic-driven grouping approach.
   The starting point of our approach is a database with medical cases for 3603 patients with peripheral arterial vascular (PAV) diseases. For these medical cases, six basic logistic variables (such as the number of visits to different specialist) are selected. Using these logistic variables, clustering techniques are used to group the medical cases in logistically homogeneous groups. In our approach, the quality of the resulting grouping is not measured by statistical significance, but by (i) the usefulness of the grouping for the creation of new multi-disciplinary units; (ii) how well patients can be selected for treatment in the new units. Given a priori knowledge of a patient (e.g. age, diagnosis), machine learning techniques are employed to induce rules that can be used for the selection of the patients eligible for treatment in the new units. In the paper, we describe the results of the above-proposed methodology for patients with PAV diseases. Two groupings and the accompanied classification rule sets are presented. One grouping is based on all the logistic variables, and another grouping is based on two latent factors found by applying factor analysis. On the basis of the experimental results, we can conclude that it is possible to search for medical logistic homogenous groups (i) that can be characterized by rules based on the aggregated logistic variables; (ii) for which we can formulate rules to predict to which cluster new patients belong.

AB Objective: The Logistic Organ Dysfunction (LOD) score has been proved effective in evaluating severity during the first day in an intensive care unit but has not been evaluated later. TO evaluate attributable mortality related to nosocomial events, organ dysfunction scores that remain accurate throughout the intensive care unit stay are needed. The objective of this study was to evaluate how accurately daily LOD scoring predicts mortality comparatively with daily Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scoring.
   Design: Prospective multicenter study.
   Setting: Six intensive care units in France.
   Patients: A total of 1685 patients with intensive care unit stays longer than 48 hrs were included in this study (511 hospital deaths). Median age was 66 yrs, and median Simplified Acute Physiology Score II at admission was 38. For each patient, a senior physician recorded the variables needed to compute organ dysfunction scores daily throughout the intensive care unit stay.
   Interventions: None.
   Measurements and Main Results: SOFA and LOD scores were computed daily during the first 7 days. Calibration was evaluated based on goodness-of-fit by the Hosmer-Lemeshow chi-square statistic (lower chi-square values and higher p values indicate better fit) and discrimination based on the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) area under the curve (AUC; a ROC-AUC of 1 indicates faultless discrimination and a ROC-AUC of 0.5 indicates the effects of chance alone). Because calibration of both scores was poor at all time points (p < .001), customization was performed using the total score (model 1) or separate introduction of each dysfunction (model 2). The performance of customized LOD and SOFA scores on a given day in predicting mortality was assessed in those patients who spent at least one more calendar day in the intensive care unit. The original LOD and SOFA scores had satisfactory ROC-AUC values (0.720 to 0.766). Internal consistency of both scores was acceptable (p < 10(-4) for each organ dysfunction). After customization, the original scores calibrated well between days 1 and 7. Discrimination by both scores was better with model 2 (AUC-ROC, 0.729-0.784).
   Conclusion: Daily LOD and SOFA scores showed good accuracy and internal consistency, and they could be used to adjust severity for events occurring in the intensive care unit.

AB The objective of this study was to compare artificial neural network (ANN) and multivariable logistic regression analyses for prediction modeling of adverse outcome in pediatric meningococcal disease. We analyzed a previously constructed database of children younger than 20 years of age with meningococcal disease at four pediatric referral hospitals from 1985-1996. Patients were randomly divided into derivation and validation datasets, Adverse outcome was defined as death or limb amputation. ANN and multivariable logistic regression models were developed using the derivation set, and were tested on the validation set. Eight variables associated with adverse outcome in previous studies of meningococcal disease were considered in both the ANN and logistic regression analyses. Accuracies of these models were then compared. There were 381 patients with meningococcal disease in the database, of whom 50 had adverse outcomes. When applied to the validation data set, the sensitivities for both the ANN and logistic regressions models were 75% and the specificities were both 91%. There were no significant differences in any of the performance Para-meters between the two models. ANN analysis is an effective tool for developing prediction models for adverse outcome of meningococcal disease in children, and has similar accuracy as logistic regression modeling. With larger, more complete databases, and with advanced ANN algorithms, this technology may become increasingly useful for real-time prediction of patient outcome. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB Objective. To analyse common and divergent features of staff-related, equipmental and spatial/logistical concepts of three large trauma centers of highest health care level.
   Methods. The health care mandate as well as the staff management, the organisational and the constructional-spacial structure of trauma room diagnostics and therapy of the trauma centers of the Universities of Leiden and Munich (Innenstadt) and the Zentralklinikum Augsburg are described. In particular the technical equipment and the process of the radiological diagnostic procedures in the trauma room are outlined.
   Results. Staff availability and basic technical equipment of the trauma rooms are comparable between the three hospitals. Divergent concepts exist concerning the complexity of the initial radiologic examination protocols. Spacial connection and importance of computed tomography are also discussed controversially. Urgent interventional procedures are increasingly performed within the trauma room. Magnetic-resonEince-tomography does not play a role in early care from multiple injured patients.
   Conclusion. Trauma centers have to meet certain personnel and technical prerequisites to guarantee a temporally optimised care for multiple injured patients. Differences between the three centers concerning the logistic sequence and the radiologic examination techniques used are mainly due to variable emphasis put on CT in the initial phase of patient care.

AB One way to monitor patient access to emergent health care services is to use patient characteristics to predict arrival time at the hospital after onset of symptoms. This predicted arrival time can then be compared with actual arrival time to allow monitoring of access to services. Predicted arrival time could also be used to estimate potential effects of changes in health care service availability, such as closure of an emergency department or an acute care hospital. Our goal was to determine the best statistical method for prediction of arrival intervals for patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) symptoms. We compared the performance of multinomial logistic regression (MLR) and discriminant analysis (DA) models. Models for MLR and DA were developed using a dataset of 3,566 male veterans hospitalized with AMI in 81 VA Medical Centers in 1994-1995 throughout the United States. The dataset was randomly divided into a training set (n = 1,846) and a test set (n = 1,720). Arrival times were grouped into three intervals on the basis of treatment considerations: <6 hours, 6-12 hours, and >12 hours. One model for MLR and two models for DA were developed using the training dataset. One DA model had equal prior probabilities, and one DA model had proportional prior probabilities, Predictive performance of the models was compared using the test (n = 1,720) dataset. Using the test dataset, the proportions of patients in the three arrival time group, were 60.9% for <6 hours, 10.3% for 6-12 hours, and 28.87c for >12 hours after symptom onset. Whereas the overall predictive performance by MLR and DA with proportional priors was higher, the DA models with equal priors performed much better in the smaller groups Correct classifications were 62.6% by MLR, 62.4% by DA using proportional prior probabilities, and 48.1% using equal prior probabilities of thew groups. The misclassifications by MLR for the three groups were 9.5%, 100.0%, 74.2% for each time interval, respectively. Misclassifications by DA models were 9.8%, 100.0%, and 74.4% for the model with proportional priors and 47.6%, 79.5%, and 51.0% for the model with equal priors. The choice of MLR or DA with proportional priors. or DA with equal priors for monitoring time intervals of predicted hospital arrival time for a population should depend on the consequences of misclassification errors.

TI Early and late recurrences after gastrectomy for gastric cancer: A
   multiple logistic regression analysis
SO UPSALA JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
ID CARCINOMA; SURGERY; NUMBER
AB Purpose: Although many studies have focused on clinical risk factors for prognosis of patients with surgically treated gastric cancer, little information is available regarding the timing of recurrent malignant disease. The purpose of this study was to determine the factors that are predictive of early and late recurrences after gastrectomy.
   Patients and Methods: We reviewed the hospital records of patients with hisotological proof of gastric cancer who were admitted to Sendai National Hospital during the period from 1985 to 1995. A total of 923 records were examined, and 251 patients with recurrent disease were identified. The patients were divided into an "early recurrence group" consisting of 195 patients (died within one year after surgery) and a "late recurrence group" of 56 patients (died two years or more after surgery). Clinicopathological characteristics were examined, and independent risk factors influencing the timing of recurrence were determined by a multiple logistic regression analysis.
   Results: The mean tumor size of early recurrence cases was larger than that of late recurrence cases (p=0.0294). Tumors penetrating the serosa with direct invasion to continuous structures were found more frequently in the early recurrence group than in the late recurrence group. The patients with early recurrence showed a higher tendency to have nodal involvement, lymphatic invasion and vascular invasion. The relative risks of early and late recurrences associated with different variables were estimated by a multiple logistic regression method. The following variables were found to be significant risk factors for early recurrence: male gender (p=0.0382), lymph node metastasis (p=0.0016), and vascular invasion (p=0.0006).
   Conclusion: Male patients who have node-positive gastric cancer with vascular invasion have a high risk of early recurrence.

AB Current management of acute stroke is characterised by an aggressive approach including specific therapy i.e. reperfusion therapy. However currently stroke patients often arrive too late in hospitals offering adequate treatment. Therefore optimized logistics play a predominant role in modern stroke management. Aims of the study: 1. Does teaching of EMS staff and the public result in reduced prehospital latencies 2. Will EMS personnel be able to effectively screen patients potentially suitable for thrombolysis? Methods: During a six week-period all EMS patients presenting with possible signs of an acute stroke were prospectively registered (period 1). Data of interest were age, mode of primary contact, prehospital latencies, mode of transportation, destination and final diagnosis. Next an algorithm was established allowing EMS personnel to transfer patients with an assumed stroke to the best suitable hospital. Teaching comprised clinical signs, indication of CT scanning, pathophysiology, specific therapeutic options (thrombolysis), and criteria to identify patients suitable for thrombolysis. in a second step the public was continuously taught about stroke symptoms and the necessity to instantly seek EMS assistance. After 12 months data were compared to baseline (period 2). Results: (period 2 vs. Period 1): Rate of patients transferred to a stroke center: 60% vs. 54%; rate of those transported to hospitals not offering CT scans: 17% vs. 26% (p<0.05). Percentage of patients primarily contacting the EMS system: 33% vs. 24%. Median interval between onset of symptoms and emergency call: 54 vs. 263 minutes Median interval between the emergency call and arrival at the emergency department: 44 vs. 58 minutes (p<0.01). Rate of patients admitted with a diagnosis other than stroke: 18% vs. 25% (n.s.). Median interval between onset of symptoms and hospital admission: 140 vs. 368 minutes (p<0.001). Median age: 69 vs. 75 years (p<0.01). Conclusion: This study demonstrates the efficacy of educational efforts in reducing latencies and in screening patients potentially suitable for thrombolysis. Future efforts will comprise more intense education of a high risk subpopulation.

AB Mutations in the gene encoding the CYP2C-19 enzyme for PPI metabolism have been shown to enhance the chance for a cure in a H. pylori-positive patients using a two-week dual-therapy regimen involving omeprazole and amoxicillin. However, the impact of CYP2C-19 genetic polymorphism on eradication rates of a one-week triple-therapy regimen has not been examined. In this cohort study, 156 H. pylori-positive peptic ulcer or NUD patients who presented to our university hospital were recruited. They were treated by one-week omeprazole-amoxicillin-clarithromycin therapy. Host and bacterial predictive factors including H. pylori susceptibility and CYP2C-19 genotyping, as well as cure rate for H. pylori infection, were studied. Cure rate was 85.9% (95% CI: 79-91%) on an intent to treat (ITT) basis. By multiple logistic regression analysis, only clarithromycin resistance had a significant impact on treatment success (odds ratio 28.7: 95% CI: 6-172). CYP2C-19 genetic polymorphism was not associated with a significant change in cure rate. These observations indicate only clarithromycin susceptibility, not CYP2C-19 polymorphism; has a major impact on the treatment success when using a seven-day OAC H. pylori treatment regimen.

AB Context: Rehospitalization following inpatient medical rehabilitation has important health and economic implications for patients who have experienced a stroke. Objective: Compare logistic regression and neural networks in predicting rehospitalization at 3-6-month follow-up for patients with stroke discharged from medical rehabilitation. Design:Thc study was retrospective using information from a national database representative of medical rehabilitation patients across the US. Setting: Information submitted to the Uniform Data System for Medical Rehabilitation from 1997 and 1998 by 167 hospital and rehabilitation facilities from 40 states was examined. Participants: 9584 patient records were included in the sample. The mean age was 70.74 years (SD = 12.87). The sample included 51.6% females and was 77.6% non-Hispanic White with an average length of stay of 21.47 days (SD = 15.47). Main Outcome Measures: Hospital readmission from 80 to 180 days following discharge. Results: Statistically significant variables (P < .05) in the logistic model included sphincter control, self-care ability, age, marital status, ethnicity and length of stay. Area under the ROC curves were 0.68 and 0.74 for logistic regression and neural network analysis, respectively. The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit chi-square was 11.32 (df = 8, P = 0.22) for neural network analysis and 16.33 (df 8, P = 0.11) for logistic regression. Calibration curves indicated a slightly better fit for the neural network model. Conclusion: There was no statistically significant or practical advantaged in predicting hospital readmission using neural network analysis in comparison to logistic regression for persons who experienced a stroke and received medical rehabilitation during the period of the study.

AB Objectives: To evaluate the performance of the logistic organ dysfunction (LOD) system for the assessment of morbidity and mortality in multiple organ dysfunction/failure (MOD/F) in an independent database and to evaluate the use of sequential LOD measurements for the prediction of outcome.
   Design and setting: Prospective, multicentric cohort study in 13 adult medical, surgical, and mixed intensive care units (ICUs) in Austria.
   Patients: A total of 2893 consecutive admissions to the ICUs.
   Measurements and main results: Patient vital status at ICU and hospital discharge was recorded. Univariate analysis showed that the LOD was able to distinguish between survivors and nonsurvivors (2 vs. 6 median score). Within organ systems, higher levels of the severity of organ dysfunction were consistently associated with higher mortality. For the prediction of hospital mortality, the original prognostic LOD model did not perform well in our patients, as indicated by the goodness-of-fit (C) over cap statistic. Using multiple logistic regression we developed a prognostic model with a satisfactory fit in our patients. The integration of further measurements during the ICU stay increased discrimination but not calibration.
   Conclusions: The LOD system is well correlated well with the numbers and levels of organ dysfunctions and discriminates well between survivors and nonsurvivors. It can thus be used to quantify the baseline severity of organ dysfunction, Moreover, after customization of the predictive equation the LOD predicted hospital mortality in our patients with high precision. It thus provides a combined measure of morbidity and mortality for critically ill patients with MOD/F.

TI Reduction in mortality after inappropriate early discharge from

SO BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL

DT Article
ID SOCIETY APACHE-II; AFTER-DISCHARGE; CASE-MIX; BRITAIN; IRELAND; SYSTEM
AB Objective To develop a predictive moder to triage patients for discharge from intensive care units to reduce mortality after discharge.
   Design Logistic regression analyses and modelling of data from patients who were discharged from intensive care units.
   Setting Guy's hospital intensive care unit and 19 other UK intensive care units from 1989 to 1998.
   Participants 5475 patients for the development of the model and 8449 for validation.
   Main outcome measures Mortality after discharge and power of triage model.
   Results Mortality after discharge from intensive care was up to 12.4%. The triage model identified patients at risk from death on the ward with a sensitivity of 65.5% and specificity of 87.6%, and an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.86. Variables in the model were age, end stage disease, length of stay in unit, cardiothoracic surgery, and physiology In the validation dataset the 34% of the patients identified as at risk had a discharge mortality of 25% compared with a 4% mortality among those not at risk.
   Conclusions The discharge mortality of at risk patients may be reduced by 39% if they remain in intensive care units for another 45 hours. The discharge triage model to identify patients at risk from too early and inappropriate discharge from intensive care may help doctors to make the difficult clinical decision of whom to discharge to make roam for a patient requiring urgent admission to the unit. If confirmed, this study has implications on the provision of resources.

AB Objective: Logistic regression (LR), commonly used for hospital mortality prediction, has limitations. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been proposed as an alternative. We compared the performance of these approaches by using stepwise reductions in sample size.
   Design: Prospective cohort study.
   Setting: Seven intensive care units (ICU) at one tertiary care center.
   Patients: Patients were 1,647 ICU admissions for whom first-day Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation III variables were collected.
   Interventions: None.
   Measurements and Main Results: We constructed LR and ANN models on a random set of 1,200 admissions (development set) and used the remaining 447 as the validation set. We repeated model construction on progressively smaller development sets (800, 400, and 200 admissions) and retested on the original validation set (n = 447). For each development set, we constructed models from two LR and two ANN architectures, organizing the independent variables differently. With the 1,200-admission development set, all models had good fit and discrimination on the Validation set, where fit was assessed by the Hosmer-Lemeshow C statistic (range, 10.6-15.3; p greater than or equal to .05) and standardized mortality ratio (SMR) (range, 0.93 [95% confidence interval, 0.79-1.15] to 7.09 [95% confidence interval, 0.89-1.38]), and discrimination was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (range, 0.80-0.84). As development set sample size decreased, model performance on the validation set deteriorated rapidly, although the ANNs retained marginally better fit at 800 (best C statistic was 26.3 [p = .0009] and 13.1 [p =.11] for the LR and ANN models). Below 800, fit was poor with both approaches, with high C statistics ranging from 22.8 [p < .004] to 633 [p < .00011] and highly biased SMRs (seven of the eight models below 800 had SMRs of <0.85, with an upper confidence interval of <1). Discrimination ranged from 0.74 to 0.84 below 800.
   Conclusions: When sample size is adequate, LR and ANN models have similar performance. However, development sets of less than or equal to 800 were generally inadequate. This is concerning, given typical sample sizes used for individual ICU mortality prediction.

AB An extension to the version of the regression calibration estimator proposed by Rosner et al, for logistic and other generalized linear regression models is given for main study/internal validation study designs. This estimator combines the information about the parameter of interest contained in the internal validation study with Rosner et al.'s regression calibration estimate, using a generalized inverse-variance weighted average. It is shown that the validation study selection model can be ignored as long as this model is jointly independent of the outcome and the incompletely observed covariates, conditional, at most, upon the surrogates and other completely observed covariates. In an extensive simulation study designed to follow a complex, multivariate setting in nutritional epidemiology, it is shown that with validation study sizes of 340 or more, this estimator appears to be asymptotically optimal in the sense that it is nearly unbiased and nearly as efficient as a properly specified maximum likelihood estimator. A modification to the regression calibration variance estimator which replaces the standard uncorrected logistic regression coefficient variance with the sandwich estimator to account for the possible misspecification of the logistic regression fit to the surrogate covariates in the main study, was also studied in this same simulation experiment. In this study, the alternative variance formula yielded results virtually identical to the original formula. A version of the proposed estimator is also derived for the case where the reference instrument, available only in the validation study, is imperfect but unbiased at the individual level and contains error that is uncorrelated with other covariates and with error in the surrogate instrument. Replicate measures are obtained in a subset of study participants. In this case it is shown that the validation study selection model can be ignored when sampling into the validation study depends, at most, only upon perfectly measured covariates. Two data sets, a study of fever in relation to occupational exposure to antineoplastics among hospital pharmacists and a study of breast cancer incidence in relation to dietary intakes of alcohol and vitamin A, adjusted for total energy intake, from the Nurses' Health Study, were analysed using these new methods. In these data, because the validation studies contained less than 200 observations and the events of interest were relatively rare, as is typical, the potential improvements offered by this new estimator were not apparent.
