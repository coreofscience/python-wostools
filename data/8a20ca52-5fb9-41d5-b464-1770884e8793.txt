AB The volatile metabolites of the headspace gas of onion bulbs inoculated with three different pathogens, Erwinia carotovora ssp. carotovora, Fusarium oxysporum and Botrytis allii, were profiled using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Differences in the number and amount of volatile metabolites were observed. Two hundred and fifty three volatile metabolites were detected in bulbs inoculated with three pathogens or sterile distilled water. On day three, 202 volatile metabolites were observed, compared to 166 on day six. Of the 253 compounds, however, only 59 occurred relatively consistently over replications, of which 25 compounds were specific to one or more pathogens, including 10 that were unique to a pathogen. Metabolites such as 1-Oxa-4,6-diazacyclooctane-5-thione and 4-mercapto-3-(methylthio)-zeta-(thio-lactone)-crotonic acid were exclusive to onions inoculated with F. oxysporum. Acetone, acetic acid-hydrazide, propylcarbamate, 1-bromo-1-propene, thiirane, 1-(methylthio)-E-1-propene and 1-ethenyl-4-ethyl-benzene were specific to B. allii. 3-bromo-furan was specific to E. carotovora ssp. carotovora. Sterile water-inoculated bulbs produced 3,3'-dioxy-1,2-propanediol-tetranitrate. Highest amount of sulfurs was found in pathogen-inoculated, while highest amounts of terpenes, aromatics and aliphatics were found in sterile distilled water-inoculated bulbs. The possible use of these differences in the volatile metabolites for detecting and discriminating diseases of onion in storage is discussed.

AB An interaction between P. infestans and E. carotovora subsp. atroseptica (Eca) in rotting tubers was confirmed and the biochemical basis for its occurrence investigated. The pH of tissue infected with P. foveata became alkaline whereas tissue infected with P. infestans or F. coeruleum did not rise above neutrality, which could promote pathogenicity of Eca by maintaining pH closer to the optimum for polygalacturonase activity. Polygalacturonase, pectate lyase and galactanase were detected in cultures of all three fungi grown on media containing cell wall material or pectin from tubers. As P. infestans produced more polygalacturonase than the other two fungal tuber rot pathogens the possibility was investigated that oligogalacturonide products of enzymatic degradation of pectin by P. infestans stimulates pathogenicity of Eca. However, while tubers soft-rotted after infiltration with supernatant from fungal cultures grown on tuber cell wall material, controls showed that rotting resulted from infiltration rather than the products contained in the infiltrated water.
