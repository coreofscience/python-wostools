TI Real-Time MEG Source Localization Using Regional Clustering
SO BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY
AB With its millisecond temporal resolution, Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is well suited for real-time monitoring of brain activity. Real-time feedback allows the adaption of the experiment to the subject's reaction and increases time efficiency by shortening acquisition and off-line analysis. Two formidable challenges exist in real-time analysis: the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the limited time available for computations. Since the low SNR reduces the number of distinguishable sources, we propose an approach which downsizes the source space based on a cortical atlas and allows to discern the sources in the presence of noise. Each cortical region is represented by a small set of dipoles, which is obtained by a clustering algorithm. Using this approach, we adapted dynamic statistical parametric mapping for real-time source localization. In terms of point spread and crosstalk between regions the proposed clustering technique performs better than selecting spatially evenly distributed dipoles. We conducted real-time source localization on MEG data from an auditory experiment. The results demonstrate that the proposed real-time method localizes sources reliably in the superior temporal gyrus. We conclude that real-time source estimation based on MEG is a feasible, useful addition to the standard on-line processing methods, and enables feedback based on neural activity during the measurements.

TI A three domain covariance framework for EEG/MEG data
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB In this paper we introduce a covariance framework for the analysis of single subject EEG and MEG data that takes into account observed temporal stationarity on small time scales and trial-to-trial variations. We formulate a model for the covariance matrix, which is a Kronecker product of three components that correspond to space, time and epochs/trials, and consider maximum likelihood estimation of the unknown parameter values. An iterative algorithm that finds approximations of the maximum likelihood estimates is proposed. Our covariance model is applicable in a variety of cases where spontaneous EEG or MEG acts as source of noise and realistic noise covariance estimates are needed, such as in evoked activity studies, or where the properties of spontaneous EEG or MEG are themselves the topic of interest, like in combined EEG-fMRI experiments in which the correlation between EEG and fMRI signals is investigated.
   We use a simulation study to assess the performance of the estimator and investigate the influence of different assumptions about the covariance factors on the estimated covariance matrix and on its components. We apply our method to real EEG and MEG data sets. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Spatial and temporal resolutions of EEG: Is it really black and white? A
   scalp current density view
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY
AB Among the different brain imaging techniques, electroencephalography (EEG) is classically considered as having an excellent temporal resolution, but a poor spatial one. Here, we argue that the actual temporal resolution of conventional (scalp potentials) EEG is overestimated, and that volume conduction, the main cause of the poor spatial resolution of EEG, also distorts the recovered time course of the underlying sources at scalp level, and hence degrades the actual temporal resolution of EEG. While Current Source Density (CSD) estimates, through the Surface Laplacian (SL) computation, are well known to dramatically reduce volume conduction effects and hence improve EEG spatial resolution, its positive impact on EEG temporal resolution is much less recognized. In two simulation studies, we first show how volume conduction and reference electrodes distort the scalp potential time course, and how SL transform provides a much better spatio-temporal description. We then exemplify similar effects on two empirical datasets. We show how the time courses of the scalp potentials mis-estimate the latencies of the relevant brain events and that CSD provides a much richer, and much more accurate, view of the spatio-temporal dynamics of brain activity.

TI Electric Field Model of Transcranial Electric Stimulation in Nonhuman
   Primates: Correspondence to Individual Motor Threshold
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB Objective: To develop a pipeline for realistic head models of nonhuman primates (NHPs) for simulations of non-invasive brain stimulation, and use these models together with empirical threshold measurements to demonstrate that the models capture individual anatomical variability. Methods: Based on structural MRI data, we created models of the electric field (E-field) induced by right unilateral (RUL) electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in four rhesus macaques. Individual motor threshold (MT) was measured with transcranial electric stimulation (TES) administered through the RUL electrodes in the same subjects. Results: The interindividual anatomical differences resulted in 57% variation in median E-field strength in the brain at fixed stimulus current amplitude. Individualization of the stimulus current by MT reduced the E-field variation in the target motor area by 27%. There was significant correlation between the measured MT and the ratio of simulated electrode current and E-field strength (r(2) = 0.95, p = 0.026). Exploratory analysis revealed significant correlations of this ratio with anatomical parameters including of the superior electrode-to-cortex distance, vertex-to-cortex distance, and brain volume (r(2) > 0.96, p < 0.02). The neural activation threshold was estimated to be 0.45 +/- 0.07 V/cm for 0.2-ms stimulus pulse width. Conclusion: These results suggest that our individual-specific NHP E-field models appropriately capture individual anatomical variability relevant to the dosing of TES/ECT. These findings are exploratory due to the small number of subjects. Significance: This study can contribute insight in NHP studies of ECT and other brain stimulation interventions, help link the results to clinical studies, and ultimately lead to more rational brain stimulation dosing paradigms.

TI APOE epsilon 4 constrains engagement of encoding-related compensatory
   networks in amnestic mild cognitive impairment
SO HIPPOCAMPUS
AB People with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), compared to healthy older adults (HO), benefit less from semantic congruent cues during episodic encoding. The presence of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) 4 makes this congruency benefit smaller, but the neural correlates of this deficit are unknown. Here, we estimated the source generators of EEG oscillatory activity associated with successful encoding of face-location associations preceded by semantically congruent and incongruent cues in HO (N=26) and aMCI subjects (N=34), 16 of which were 4 carriers (4(+)) and 18 4 noncarriers (4(-)). Source estimation was performed in those spectrotemporal windows where the power of low-alpha, high-alpha, and beta oscillatory activity differed either between congruent and incongruent faces or between groups. Differences in high-alpha and beta-oscillatory dynamics indicated that aMCI 4(+) are unable to activate lateral regions of the temporal lobe involved in associative memory and congruency benefit in HO. Interestingly, and regardless of APOE genotype, aMCI activated additional regions relative to HO, through alpha oscillations. However, only activation in a distributed fronto-temporo-parietal network in 4 noncarriers was paralleled by enhanced memory. On the contrary, the redundant prefrontal activation shown by aMCI 4(+) did not prevent performance from decreasing. These results indicate that the effect of aMCI-related degeneracy on functional networks is constrained by the presence of APOE 4. Whereas individuals with aMCI 4(-) activate attentional, perceptual and semantic compensatory networks, aMCI 4(+) show reduced processing efficiency and capacity. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Joint Eigenvalue Decomposition of Non-Defective Matrices Based on the LU
   Factorization With Application to ICA
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING
AB In this paper we propose a fast and efficient Jacobi-like approach named JET (Joint Eigenvalue decomposition based on Triangular matrices) for the Joint EigenValue Decomposition (JEVD) of a set of real or complex non-defective matrices based on the LU factorization of the matrix of eigenvectors. Contrarily to classical Jacobi-like JEVD methods, the iterative procedure of the JET approach can be reduced to the search for only one of the two triangular matrices involved in the factorization of the matrix of eigenvectors, hence decreasing the numerical complexity. Two variants of the JET technique, namely JET-U and JET-O, which correspond to the optimization of two different cost functions are described in detail and these are extended to the complex case. Numerical simulations show that in many practical cases the JET approach provides more accurate estimation of the matrix of eigenvectors than its competitors and that the lowest numerical complexity is consistently achieved by the JET-U algorithm. In addition, we illustrate in the ICA context the interest of being able to solve efficiently the (non-orthogonal) JEVD problem. More particularly, based on our JET-U algorithm, we propose a more robust version of an existing ICA method, named MICAR-U. The identifiability of the latter is studied and proved under some conditions. Computer results given in the context of brain interfaces show the better ability of MICAR-U to denoise simulated electrocortical data compared to classical ICA techniques for low signal to noise ratio values.

TI Temporally Dissociable Contributions of Human Medial Prefrontal
   Subregions to Reward-Guided Learning
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE
AB In decision making, dorsal and ventral medial prefrontal cortex show a sensitivity to key decision variables, such as reward prediction errors. It is unclear whether these signals reflect parallel processing of a common synchronous input to both regions, for example from mesocortical dopamine, or separate and consecutive stages in reward processing. These two perspectives make distinct predictions about the relative timing of feedback-related activity in each of these regions, a question we address here. To reconstruct the unique temporal contribution of dorsomedial (dmPFC) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) to simultaneously measured EEG activity in human subjects, we developed a novel trialwise fMRI-informed EEG analysis that allows dissociating correlated and overlapping sources. We show that vmPFC uniquely contributes a sustained activation profile shortly after outcome presentation, whereas dmPFC contributes a later and more peaked activation pattern. This temporal dissociation is expressed mainly in the alpha band for a vmPFC signal, which contrasts with a theta based dmPFC signal. Thus, our data show reward-related vmPFC and dmPFC responses have distinct time courses and unique spectral profiles, findings that support distinct functional roles in a reward-processing network.

TI Detection of short-term activity avalanches in human brain default mode
   network with ultrafast MR encephalography
SO FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE
AB Recent studies pinpoint visually cued networks of avalanches with MEG/EEG data. Co-activation pattern (CAP) analysis can be used to detect single brain volume activity profiles and hemodynamic fingerprints of neuronal avalanches as sudden high signal activity peaks in classical fMRI data. In this study, we aimed to detect dynamic patterns of brain activity spreads with the use of ultrafast MR encephalography (MREG). MREG achieves 10 Hz whole brain sampling, allowing the estimation of spatial spread of an avalanche, even with the inherent hemodynamic delay of the BOLD signal. We developed a novel computational method to separate avalanche type fast activity spreads from motion artifacts, vasomotor fluctuations, and cardio-respiratory noise in human brain default mode network (DMN). Reproducible and classical DMN sources were identified using spatial ICA prior to advanced noise removal in order to assure that ICA converges to reproducible networks. Brain activity peaks were identified from parts of the DMN, and normalized MREG data around each peak were extracted individually to show dynamic avalanche type spreads as video clips within the DMN. Individual activity spread video clips of specific parts of the DMN were then averaged over the group of subjects. The experiments show that the high BOLD values around the peaks are mostly spreading along the spatial pattern of the particular DMN segment detected with ICA. With also the spread size and lifetime resembling the expected power law distributions, this indicates that the detected peaks are parts of activity avalanches, starting from (or crossing) the DMN. Furthermore, the split, one-sided sub-networks of the DMN show different spread directions within the same DMN framework. The results open possibilities to follow up brain activity avalanches in the hope to understand more about the system wide properties of diseases related to DMN dysfunction.

TI Use of electric field orientation as an index for estimating the
   contribution of model complexity in transcranial direct current
   stimulation forward head model development
SO IET SCIENCE MEASUREMENT & TECHNOLOGY
AB The study evaluates the role of human skull composition and brain anisotropy in the context of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) based predictive modeling. Four head models were developed and each proposed attribute (cancellous bone and brain anisotropy) was compared with the isotropic model. By employing a single high-definition montage, the efficacy of each attribute in shaping induced electric field was analyzed by its magnitude and orientation information. Relative error (RE) was used to estimate the variation in field magnitude. It was observed that for a given high-definition montage, the brain anisotropy contributed to 5% change (RE) in the strength of the gray matter (GM) electric field and 10% for the white matter (WM). Inclusion of diploe in the model resulted in 45% variation in the magnitude of the brain electric field. On average, brain anisotropy contributed to field deviations of up to 20 degrees in major WM fiber tracts. Skull heterogeneity caused field deviations of up to 35 degrees in diploe, 15 degrees in subcutaneous fat and marginal variations in brain regions. These simulation results demonstrated the importance of considering refinement in forward models of tDCS, especially; the role of diploe should be considered for more accurate field assessments.

TI OPTIMAL DESIGN FOR PARAMETER ESTIMATION IN EEG PROBLEMS IN A 3D
   MULTILAYERED DOMAIN
SO MATHEMATICAL BIOSCIENCES AND ENGINEERING
AB The fundamental problem of collecting data in the "best way" in order to assure statistically efficient estimation of parameters is known as Optimal Experimental Design. Many inverse problems consist in selecting best parameter values of a given mathematical model based on fits to measured data. These are usually formulated as optimization problems and the accuracy of their solutions depends not only on the chosen optimization scheme but also on the given data. We consider an electromagnetic interrogation problem, specifically one arising in an electroencephalography (EEG) problem, of finding optimal number and locations for sensors for source identification in a 3D unit sphere from data on its boundary. In this effort we compare the use of the classical D-optimal criterion for observation points as opposed to that for a uniform observation mesh. We consider location and best number of sensors and report results based on statistical uncertainty analysis of the resulting estimated parameters.

TI Model selection using limiting distributions of second-order blind
   source separation algorithms
SO SIGNAL PROCESSING
AB Signals, recorded over time, are often observed as mixtures of multiple source signals. To extract relevant information from such measurements one needs to determine the mixing coefficients. In case of weakly stationary time series with uncorrelated source signals, this separation can be achieved by jointly diagonalizing sample autocovariances at different lags, and several algorithms address this task. Often the mixing estimates contain close-to-zero entries and one wants to decide whether the corresponding source signals have a relevant impact on the observations or not. To address this question of model selection we consider the recently published second-order blind identification procedures SOBIdef and SOBIsym which provide limiting distributions of the mixing estimates. For the first time, such distributions enable informed decisions about the presence of second-order stationary source signals in the data. We consider a family of linear hypothesis tests and information criteria to perform model selection as second step after parameter estimation. In simulations we consider different time series models. We validate the model selection performance and demonstrate a good recovery of the true zero pattern of the mixing (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI How to use fMRI functional localizers to improve EEG/MEG source
   estimation
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS
AB EEG and MEG have excellent temporal resolution, but the estimation of the neural sources that generate the signals recorded by the sensors is a difficult, ill-posed problem. The high spatial resolution of functional MRI makes it an ideal tool to improve the localization of the EEG/MEG sources using data fusion. However, the combination of the two techniques remains challenging, as the neural generators of the EEG/MEG and BOLD signals might in some cases be very different. Here we describe a data fusion approach that was developed by our team over the last decade in which fMRI is used to provide source constraints that are based on functional areas defined individually for each subject. This mini-review describes the different steps that are necessary to perform source estimation using this approach. It also provides a list of pitfalls that should be avoided when doing fMRI-informed EEG/MEG source imaging. Finally, it describes the advantages of using a ROI-based approach for group-level analysis and for the study of sensory systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Adaptive Stacked Generalization for Multiclass Motor Imagery-Based Brain
   Computer Interfaces
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING
AB Practical motor imagery-based brain computer interface (MI-BCI) applications are limited by the difficult to decode brain signals in a reliable way. In this paper, we propose a processing framework to address non-stationarity, as well as handle spectral, temporal, and spatial characteristics associated with execution of motor tasks. Stacked generalization is used to exploit the power of classifier ensembles for combining information coming from multiple sources and reducing the existing uncertainty in EEG signals. The outputs of several regularized linear discriminant analysis (RLDA) models are combined to account for temporal, spatial, and spectral information. The resultant algorithm is called stacked RLDA (SRLDA). Additionally, an adaptive processing stage is introduced before classification to reduce the harmful effect of intersession non-stationarity. The benefits of the proposed method are evaluated on the BCI Competition IV dataset 2a. We demonstrate its effectiveness in binary and multiclass settings with four different motor imagery tasks: left-hand, right-hand, both feet, and tongue movements. The results show that adaptive SRLDA outperforms the winner of the competition and other approaches tested on this multiclass dataset.

TI STRAPS: A Fully Data-Driven Spatio-Temporally Regularized Algorithm for
   M/EEG Patch Source Imaging
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEURAL SYSTEMS
AB For M/EEG-based distributed source imaging, it has been established that the L-2-norm-based methods are effective in imaging spatially extended sources, whereas the L-1-norm-based methods are more suited for estimating focal and sparse sources. However, when the spatial extents of the sources are unknown a priori, the rationale for using either type of methods is not adequately supported. Bayesian inference by exploiting the spatio-temporal information of the patch sources holds great promise as a tool for adaptive source imaging, but both computational and methodological limitations remain to be overcome. In this paper, based on state-space modeling of the M/EEG data, we propose a fully data-driven and scalable algorithm, termed STRAPS, for M/EEG patch source imaging on high-resolution cortices. Unlike the existing algorithms, the recursive penalized least squares (RPLS) procedure is employed to efficiently estimate the source activities as opposed to the computationally demanding Kalman filtering/smoothing. Furthermore, the coefficients of the multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) model characterizing the spatial-temporal dynamics of the patch sources are estimated in a principled manner via empirical Bayes. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate STRAPS's excellent performance in the estimation of locations, spatial extents and amplitudes of the patch sources with varying spatial extents.

TI Brain dynamics of meal size selection in humans
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB Although neuroimaging research has evidenced specific responses to visual food stimuli based on their nutritional quality (e.g., energy density, fat content), brain processes underlying portion size selection remain largely unexplored. We identified spatio-temporal brain dynamics in response to meal images varying in portion size during a task of ideal portion selection for prospective lunch intake and expected satiety. Brain responses to meal portions judged by the participants as 'too small', 'ideal' and 'too big' were measured by means of electro-encephalographic (EEG) recordings in 21 normal-weight women. During an early stage of meal viewing (105-145 ms), data showed an incremental increase of the head-surface global electric field strength (quantified via global field power; GFP) as portion judgments ranged from 'too small' to 'too big'. Estimations of neural source activity revealed that brain regions underlying this effect were located in the insula, middle frontal gyrus and middle temporal gyrus, and are similar to those reported in previous studies investigating responses to changes in food nutritional content. In contrast, during a later stage (230-270ms), GFPwasmaximal for the 'ideal' relative to the 'non-ideal' portion sizes. Greater neural source activity to 'ideal' vs. 'non-ideal' portion sizeswas observed in the inferior parietal lobule, superior temporal gyrus and mid-posterior cingulate gyrus. Collectively, our results provide evidence that several brain regions involved in attention and adaptive behavior track 'ideal' meal portion sizes as early as 230ms during visual encounter. That is, responses do not showan increase paralleling theamount of food viewed (and, in extension, the amount of reward), but are shaped by regulatory mechanisms. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC) is a standard localization method which is based on the idea of dividing the vector space of the data into two subspaces: signal subspace and noise subspace. The brain, divided into several grid points, is scanned entirely and the grid point with the maximum consistency with the signal subspace is considered as the source location. In one of the MUSIC variants called Recursively Applied and Projected MUSIC (RAP-MUSIC), multiple iterations are proposed in order to decrease the location estimation uncertainties introduced by subspace estimation errors. In this paper, we suggest a new method called Self-Consistent MUSIC (SC-MUSIC) which extends RAP-MUSIC to a self-consistent algorithm. This method, SC-MUSIC, is based on the idea that the presence of several sources has a bias on the localization of each source. This bias can be reduced by projecting out all other sources mutually rather than iteratively. While the new method is applicable in all situations when MUSIC is applicable we will study here the localization of interacting sources using the imaginary part of the cross-spectrum due to the robustness of this measure to the artifacts of volume conduction. For an odd number of sources this matrix is rank deficient similar to covariance matrices of fully correlated sources. In such cases MUSIC and RAP-MUSIC fail completely while the new method accurately localizes all sources. We present results of the method using simulations of odd and even number of interacting sources in the presence of different noise levels. We compare the method with three other source localization methods: RAP-MUSIC, dipole fit and MOCA (combined with minimum norm estimate) through simulations. SC-MUSIC shows substantial improvement in the localization accuracy compared to these methods. We also show results for real MEG data of a single subject in the resting state. Four sources are localized in the sensorimotor area at f = 11 Hz which is the expected region for the idle rhythm. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Source Analysis of Event-Related Potentials During Pitch Discrimination
   and Pitch Memory Tasks
SO BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY
AB Our previous studies using fMRI have demonstrated that activations in human auditory cortex (AC) are strongly dependent on the characteristics of the task. The present study tested whether source estimation of scalp-recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) can be used to investigate task-dependent AC activations. Subjects were presented with frequency-varying two-part tones during pitch discrimination, pitch n-back memory, and visual tasks identical to our previous fMRI study (Rinne et al., J Neurosci 29:13338-13343, 2009). ERPs and their minimum-norm source estimates in AC were strongly modulated by task at 200-700 ms from tone onset. As in the fMRI study, the pitch discrimination and pitch memory tasks were associated with distinct AC activation patterns. In the pitch discrimination task, increased activity in the anterior AC was detected relatively late at 300-700 ms from tone onset. Therefore, this activity was probably not associated with enhanced pitch processing but rather with the actual discrimination process (comparison between the two parts of tone). Increased activity in more posterior areas associated with the pitch memory task, in turn, occurred at 200-700 ms suggesting that this activity was related to operations on pitch categories after pitch analysis was completed. Finally, decreased activity associated with the pitch memory task occurred at 150-300 ms consistent with the notion that, in the demanding pitch memory task, spectrotemporal analysis is actively halted as soon as category information has been obtained. These results demonstrate that ERP source analysis can be used to complement fMRI to investigate task-dependent activations of human AC.

TI Multiple linear regression to estimate time-frequency
   electrophysiological responses in single trials
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB Transient sensory, motor or cognitive event elicit not only phase-locked event-related potentials (ERPs) in the ongoing electroencephalogram (EEG), but also induce non-phase-locked modulations of ongoing EEG oscillations. These modulations can be detected when single-trial waveforms are analysed in the time-frequency domain, and consist in stimulus-induced decreases (event-related desynchronization, ERD) or increases (event-related synchronization, ERS) of synchrony in the activity of the underlying neuronal populations. ERD and ERS reflect changes in the parameters that control oscillations in neuronal networks and, depending on the frequency at which they occur, represent neuronal mechanisms involved in cortical activation, inhibition and binding. ERD and ERS are commonly estimated by averaging the time-frequency decomposition of single trials. However, their trial-to-trial variability that can reflect physiologically-important information is lost by across-trial averaging. Here, we aim to (1) develop novel approaches to explore single-trial parameters (including latency, frequency and magnitude) of ERP/ERD/ERS; (2) disclose the relationship between estimated single-trial parameters and other experimental factors (e.g., perceived intensity). We found that (1) stimulus-elicited ERP/ERD/ERS can be correctly separated using principal component analysis (PCA) decomposition with Varimax rotation on the single-trial time-frequency distributions; (2) time-frequency multiple linear regression with dispersion term (TF-MLRd) enhances the signal-tonoise ratio of ERP/ERD/ERS in single trials, and provides an unbiased estimation of their latency, frequency, and magnitude at single-trial level; (3) these estimates can be meaningfully correlated with each other and with other experimental factors at single-trial level (e.g., perceived stimulus intensity and ERP magnitude). The methods described in this article allow exploring fully non-phase-locked stimulus-induced cortical oscillations, obtaining single-trial estimate of response latency, frequency, and magnitude. This permits within-subject statistical comparisons, correlation with pre-stimulus features, and integration of simultaneously-recorded EEG and fMRI. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI Using a motion capture system for spatial localization of EEG electrodes
SO Frontiers in Neuroscience
AB Electroencephalography (EEG) is often used in source analysis studies, in which the locations of cortex regions responsible for a signal are determined. For this to be possible, accurate positions of the electrodes at the scalp surface must be determined, otherwise errors in the source estimation will occur. Today, several methods for acquiring these positions exist but they are often not satisfyingly accurate or take a long time to perform. Therefore, in this paper we describe a method capable of determining the positions accurately and fast. This method uses an infrared light motion capture system (IR-MOCAP) with 8 cameras arranged around a human participant. It acquires 3D coordinates of each electrode and automatically labels them. Each electrode has a small reflector on top of it thus allowing its detection by the cameras. We tested the accuracy of the presented method by acquiring the electrodes positions on a rigid sphere model and comparing these with measurements from computer tomography (CT). The average Euclidean distance between the sphere model CT measurements and the presented method was 1.23 mm with an average standard deviation of 0.51 mm. We also tested the method with a human participant. The measurement was quickly performed and all positions were captured. These results tell that, with this method, it is possible to acquire electrode positions with minimal error and little time effort for the study participants and investigators.

TI Perceived Communicative Context and Emotional Content Amplify Visual
   Word Processing in the Fusiform Gyrus
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE
AB The personal significance of a language statement depends on its communicative context. However, this is rarely taken into account in neuroscience studies. Here, we investigate how the implied source of single word statements alters their cortical processing. Participants' brain event-related potentials were recorded in response to identical word streams consisting of positive, negative, and neutral trait adjectives stated to either represent personal trait feedback from a human or to be randomly generated by a computer. Results showed a strong impact of perceived sender. Regardless of content, the notion of receiving feedback from a human enhanced all components, starting with the P2 and encompassing early posterior negativity (EPN), P3, and the late positive potential (LPP). Moreover, negative feedback by the "human sender" elicited a larger EPN, whereas positive feedback generally induced a larger LPP. Source estimations revealed differences between "senders" in visual areas, particularly the bilateral fusiform gyri. Likewise, emotional content enhanced activity in these areas. These results specify how even implied sender identity changes the processing of single words in seemingly realistic communicative settings, amplifying their processing in the visual brain. This suggests that the concept of motivated attention extends from stimulus significance to simultaneous appraisal of contextual relevance. Finally, consistent with distinct stages of emotional processing, at least in contexts perceived as social, humans are initially alerted to negative content, but later process what is perceived as positive feedback more intensely.

TI Influence of the head model on EEG and MEG source connectivity analyses
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB The results of brain connectivity analysis using reconstructed source time courses derived from EEG and MEG data depend on a number of algorithmic choices. While previous studies have investigated the influence of the choice of source estimation method or connectivity measure, the effects of the head modeling errors or simplifications have not been studied sufficiently.
   In the present simulation study, we investigated the influence of particular properties of the head model on the reconstructed source time courses as well as on source connectivity analysis in EEG and MEG. Therefore, we constructed a realistic head model and applied the finite element method to solve the EEG and MEG forward problems. We considered the distinction between white and gray matter, the distinction between compact and spongy bone, the inclusion of a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compartment, and the reduction to a simple 3-layer model comprising only the skin, skull, and brain. Source time courses were reconstructed using a beamforming approach and the source connectivity was estimated by the imaginary coherence (ICoh) and the generalized partial directed coherence (GPDC).
   Our results show that in both EEG and MEG, neglecting the white and gray matter distinction or the CSF causes considerable errors in reconstructed source time courses and connectivity analysis, while the distinction between spongy and compact bone is just of minor relevance, provided that an adequate skull conductivity value is used. Large inverse and connectivity errors are found in the same regions that show large topography errors in the forward solution. Moreover, we demonstrate that the very conservative ICoh is relatively safe from the crosstalk effects caused by imperfect head models, as opposed to the GPDC. (C) 2015 The Authors.

TI The electrophysiological effects of the serotonin 1A receptor agonist
   buspirone in emotional face processing
SO EUROPEAN NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY
AB Emotional face processing is critically modulated by the serotonergic system, and serotonin (5-HT) receptor agonists impair emotional face processing. However, the specific contribution of the 5-HT1A receptor remains poorly understood. Here we investigated the spatiotemporal brain mechanisms underpinning the modulation of emotional face processing induced by buspirone, a partial 5-HT1A receptor agonist. In a psychophysical discrimination of emotional faces task, we observed that the discrimination fearful versus neutral faces were reduced, but not happy versus neutral faces. Electrical neuroimaging analyses were applied to visual evoked potentials elicited by emotional face images, after placebo and buspirone administration. Buspirone modulated response strength (i.e., global field power) in the interval 230-248 ms after stimulus onset. Distributed source estimation over this time interval revealed that buspirone decreased the neural activity in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex that was evoked by fearful faces. These results indicate temporal and valence-specific effects of buspirone on the neuronal correlates of emotional face processing. Furthermore, the reduced neural activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in response to fearful faces suggests a reduced attention to fearful faces. Collectively, these findings provide new insights into the role of 5-HT1A receptors in emotional face processing and have implications for affective disorders that are characterized by an increased attention to negative stimuli.

TI Magnetoencephalographic accuracy profiles for the detection of auditory
   pathway sources
SO BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING-BIOMEDIZINISCHE TECHNIK
AB The detection limits for cortical and brain stem sources associated with the auditory pathway are examined in order to analyse brain responses at the limits of the audible frequency range. The results obtained from this study are also relevant to other issues of auditory brain research. A complementary approach consisting of recordings of magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data and simulations of magnetic field distributions is presented in this work. A biomagnetic phantom consisting of a spherical volume filled with a saline solution and four current dipoles is built. The magnetic fields outside of the phantom generated by the current dipoles are then measured for a range of applied electric dipole moments with a planar multichannel SQUID magnetometer device and a helmet MEG gradiometer device. The inclusion of a magnetometer system is expected to be more sensitive to brain stem sources compared with a gradiometer system. The same electrical and geometrical configuration is simulated in a forward calculation. From both the measured and the simulated data, the dipole positions are estimated using an inverse calculation. Results are obtained for the reconstruction accuracy as a function of applied electric dipole moment and depth of the current dipole. We found that both systems can localize cortical and subcortical sources at physiological dipole strength even for brain stem sources. Further, we found that a planar magnetometer system is more suitable if the position of the brain source can be restricted in a limited region of the brain. If this is not the case, a helmet-shaped sensor system offers more accurate source estimation.

TI Source Space Estimation of Oscillatory Power and Brain Connectivity in
   Tinnitus
SO PLOS ONE
AB Tinnitus is the perception of an internally generated sound that is postulated to emerge as a result of structural and functional changes in the brain. However, the precise pathophysiology of tinnitus remains unknown. Llinas' thalamocortical dysrhythmia model suggests that neural deafferentation due to hearing loss causes a dysregulation of coherent activity between thalamus and auditory cortex. This leads to a pathological coupling of theta and gamma oscillatory activity in the resting state, localised to the auditory cortex where normally alpha oscillations should occur. Numerous studies also suggest that tinnitus perception relies on the interplay between auditory and non-auditory brain areas. According to the Global Brain Model, a network of global fronto-parietal-cingulate areas is important in the generation and maintenance of the conscious perception of tinnitus. Thus, the distress experienced by many individuals with tinnitus is related to the top-down influence of this global network on auditory areas. In this magnetoencephalographic study, we compare resting-state oscillatory activity of tinnitus participants and normal-hearing controls to examine effects on spectral power as well as functional and effective connectivity. The analysis is based on beamformer source projection and an atlas-based region-of-interest approach. We find increased functional connectivity within the auditory cortices in the alpha band. A significant increase is also found for the effective connectivity from a global brain network to the auditory cortices in the alpha and beta bands. We do not find evidence of effects on spectral power. Overall, our results provide only limited support for the thalamocortical dysrhythmia and Global Brain models of tinnitus.

TI Combined EEG/MEG Can Outperform Single Modality EEG or MEG Source
   Reconstruction in Presurgical Epilepsy Diagnosis
SO PLOS ONE
AB We investigated two important means for improving source reconstruction in presurgical epilepsy diagnosis. The first investigation is about the optimal choice of the number of epileptic spikes in averaging to (1) sufficiently reduce the noise bias for an accurate determination of the center of gravity of the epileptic activity and (2) still get an estimation of the extent of the irritative zone. The second study focuses on the differences in single modality EEG (80-electrodes) or MEG (275-gradiometers) and especially on the benefits of combined EEG/MEG (EMEG) source analysis. Both investigations were validated with simultaneous stereo-EEG (sEEG) (167-contacts) and low-density EEG (ldEEG) (21-electrodes). To account for the different sensitivity profiles of EEG and MEG, we constructed a six-compartment finite element head model with anisotropic white matter conductivity, and calibrated the skull conductivity via somatosensory evoked responses. Our results show that, unlike single modality EEG or MEG, combined EMEG uses the complementary information of both modalities and thereby allows accurate source reconstructions also at early instants in time (epileptic spike onset), i.e., time points with low SNR, which are not yet subject to propagation and thus supposed to be closer to the origin of the epileptic activity. EMEG is furthermore able to reveal the propagation pathway at later time points in agreement with sEEG, while EEG or MEG alone reconstructed only parts of it. Subaveraging provides important and accurate information about both the center of gravity and the extent of the epileptogenic tissue that neither single nor grand-averaged spike localizations can supply.

TI Automated model selection in covariance estimation and spatial whitening
   of MEG and EEG signals
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB Magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography (M/EEG) measure non-invasively the weak electromagnetic fields induced by post-synaptic neural currents. The estimation of the spatial covariance of the signals recorded on M/EEG sensors is a building block of modern data analysis pipelines. Such covariance estimates are used in brain-computer interfaces (BCI) systems, in nearly all source localization methods for spatial whitening as well as for data covariance estimation in beamformers. The rationale for such models is that the signals can be modeled by a zero mean Gaussian distribution. While maximizing the Gaussian likelihood seems natural, it leads to a covariance estimate known as empirical covariance (EC). It turns out that the EC is a poor estimate of the true covariance when the number of samples is small. To address this issue the estimation needs to be regularized. The most common approach downweights off-diagonal coefficients, while more advanced regularization methods are based on shrinkage techniques or generative models with low rank assumptions: probabilistic PCA (PPCA) and factor analysis (FA). Using cross-validation all of these models can be tuned and compared based on Gaussian likelihood computed on unseen data.
   We investigated these models on simulations, one electroencephalography (EEG) dataset as well as magnetoencephalography (MEG) datasets from the most common MEG systems. First, our results demonstrate that different models can be the best, depending on the number of samples, heterogeneity of sensor types and noise properties. Second, we show that the models tuned by cross-validation are superior to models with hand-selected regularization. Hence, we propose an automated solution to the often overlooked problem of covariance estimation of M/EEG signals. The relevance of the procedure is demonstrated here for spatial whitening and source localization of MEG signals. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI MEG source reconstruction based on identification of directed source
   interactions on whole-brain anatomical networks
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB We present an MEG source reconstruction method that simultaneously reconstructs source amplitudes and identifies source interactions across the whole brain. In the proposed method, a full multivariate autoregressive (MAR) model formulates directed interactions (i.e., effective connectivity) between sources. The MAR coefficients (the entries of the MAR matrix) are constrained by the prior knowledge of whole-brain anatomical networks inferred from diffusion MRI. Moreover, to increase the accuracy and robustness of our method, we apply an fMRI prior on the spatial activity patterns and a sparse prior on the MAR coefficients. The observation process of MEG data, the source dynamics, and a series of the priors are combined into a Bayesian framework using a state-space representation. The parameters, such as the source amplitudes and the MAR coefficients, are jointly estimated from a variational Bayesian learning algorithm. By formulating the source dynamics in the context of MEG source reconstruction, and unifying the estimations of source amplitudes and interactions, we can identify the effective connectivity without requiring the selection of regions of interest. Our method is quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated on simulated and experimental data, respectively. Compared with non-dynamic methods, in which the interactions are estimated after source reconstruction with no dynamic constraints, the proposed dynamic method improves most of the performance measures in simulations, and provides better physiological interpretation and inter-subject consistency in real data applications.

TI Context-sensitivity of the feedback-related negativity for zero-value
   feedback outcomes
SO BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY
AB The present study investigated whether the same visual stimulus indicating zero-value feedback ((sic)0) elicits feedback-related negativity (FRN) variation, depending on whether the outcomes correspond with expectations or not.
   Thirty-one volunteers performed a monetary incentive delay (MID) task while EEG was recorded. FRN amplitudes were comparable and more negative when zero-value outcome deviated from expectations than with expected gain or loss, supporting theories emphasising the impact of unexpectedness and salience on FRN amplitudes. Surprisingly, expected zero-value outcomes elicited the most negative FRNs. However, source localisation showed that such outcomes evoked less activation in cingulate areas than unexpected zero-value outcomes.
   Our study illustrates the context dependency of identical zero-value feedback stimuli. Moreover, the results indicate that the incentive cues in the MID task evoke different reward prediction error signals. These prediction signals differ in FRN amplitude and neuronal sources, and have to be considered in the design and interpretation of future studies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI EEG based brain source localization comparison of sLORETA and eLORETA
SO AUSTRALASIAN PHYSICAL & ENGINEERING SCIENCES IN MEDICINE
AB Human brain generates electromagnetic signals during certain activation inside the brain. The localization of the active sources which are responsible for such activation is termed as brain source localization. This process of source estimation with the help of EEG which is also known as EEG inverse problem is helpful to understand physiological, pathological, mental, functional abnormalities and cognitive behaviour of the brain. This understanding leads for the specification for diagnoses of various brain disorders such as epilepsy and tumour. Different approaches are devised to exactly localize the active sources with minimum localization error, less complexity and more validation which include minimum norm, low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA), standardized LORETA, exact LORETA, Multiple Signal classifier, focal under determined system solution etc. This paper discusses and compares the ability of localizing the sources for two low resolution methods i.e., sLORETA and eLORETA respectively. The ERP data with visual stimulus is used for comparison at four different time instants for both methods (sLORETA and eLORETA) and then corresponding activation in terms of scalp map, slice view and cortex map is discussed.

TI Spatiotemporal Brain Dynamics of Emotional Face Processing Modulations
   Induced by the Serotonin 1A/2A Receptor Agonist Psilocybin
SO CEREBRAL CORTEX
AB Emotional face processing is critically modulated by the serotonergic system. For instance, emotional face processing is impaired by acute psilocybin administration, a serotonin (5-HT) 1A and 2A receptor agonist. However, the spatiotemporal brain mechanisms underlying these modulations are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the spatiotemporal brain dynamics underlying psilocybin-induced modulations during emotional face processing. Electrical neuroimaging analyses were applied to visual evoked potentials in response to emotional faces, following psilocybin and placebo administration. Our results indicate a first time period of strength (i.e., Global Field Power) modulation over the 168-189 ms poststimulus interval, induced by psilocybin. A second time period of strength modulation was identified over the 211-242 ms poststimulus interval. Source estimations over these 2 time periods further revealed decreased activity in response to both neutral and fearful faces within limbic areas, including amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus, and the right temporal cortex over the 168-189 ms interval, and reduced activity in response to happy faces within limbic and right temporo-occipital brain areas over the 211-242 ms interval. Our results indicate a selective and temporally dissociable effect of psilocybin on the neuronal correlates of emotional face processing, consistent with a modulation of the top-down control.

TI Proposal for a new MEG-MRI co-registration: A 3D laser scanner system
SO CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB Objective: Co-registration between the head shape extracted from anatomical images that are obtained using a 3D digitizer is a non-negligible factor for magnetoencephalographic (MEG) utilization. The study aimed to propose a novel quick system based on a laser scanning technique involving a 3D laser scanner system that allows instant measurement while maintaining high accuracy and reproducibility.
   Methods: The measurement duration, accuracy, and reproducibility of the finger representations in response to tactile stimulation between the 3D laser scanner-based method and the conventional magnetic field digitizer-based method were compared in 11 healthy subjects. Day-to-day variance in target registration error (TRE), day-to-day and session-to-session variability in head position indicator error (HRE) and source localization accuracy were evaluated with visualization of the source estimation and analysis of variance (ANOVA).
   Results: Our proposed one-snapshot approach enabled 3D digitization measurements in < 5 s, and significantly reduced TRE, while mean HREs were a comparable level. Although there was less dramatic improvement of source localization, we found a significant reduction in session-to-session variability and day-to-day variance using our proposed method.
   Conclusions: Our results clearly demonstrated improvements in speed, comfort, accuracy, and reproducibility when using our new MEG co-registration method.
   Significance: A systematic improvement in MEG measurement will be beneficial for routine clinical use. (C) 2014 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Robust Coherent Sensor Combining With Decision Directed Reversal
   Correction
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT
AB Measurement of a single source by multiple sensors can produce signals that are synchronous but reversed: one signal rises while the other falls. Combining the signals can produce a better signal quality than a single sensor, but detection and correction of the reversals is crucial to avoid destructive interference. Conventional time delay estimation (TDE) methods are good detection tools but may be hampered by conditions such as drift, low signal to noise ratios, and burst interference. Furthermore, these methods are designed for stationary periodic signals, and are susceptible to nonstationary behavior present in the physical world. A method of detection based on the signal slope and a fused reference is presented. Simulations for signals with varying levels of interference were analyzed. A tradeoff between immunity to drift and immunity to noise was controllable by a window length parameter. The proposed method was robust to the simulated interference, withstanding more than 10-dB higher noise and drift than conventional TDE methods. A real-world experiment to extract breathing from a bed-based pressure sensor array was also run. Mean correlations of extracted respiration to gold standard respiration curves were 0.863, achieving a 32% performance improvement over not detecting and correcting the reversals, and a 7% improvement over the conventional detection methods.

TI Advanced daytime polysomnographic preprocessing: A versatile approach
   for stream-wise estimation
SO DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING
AB The enhancement of monitoring biosignals plays a crucial role to thrive successfully computer-assisted diagnosis, ergo the deployment of outstanding approaches is an ongoing field of research demand. In the present article, a computational prototype for preprocessing short daytime polysomnographic (sdPSG) recordings based on advanced estimation techniques is introduced. The postulated model is capable of performing data segmentation, baseline correction, whitening, embedding artefacts removal and noise cancellation upon multivariate sdPSG data sets. The methodological framework includes Karhunen-Loeve Transformation (KLT), Blind Source Separation with Second Order Statistics (BSS-SOS) and Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT) to attain low-order, time-to-diagnosis efficiency and modular autonomy. The data collected from 10 voluntary subjects were preprocessed by the model, in order to evaluate the withdrawal of noisy and artefactual activity from electroencephalographic (EEG) and electrooculographic (EGG) channels. The performance metrics are distinguished in qualitative (visual inspection) and quantitative manner, such as: Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). The computational model demonstrated a complete artefact rejection in 80% of the preprocessed epochs, 4 to 8 dB for residual error and 12 to 30 dB in signal-to-noise gain after denoising trial. In comparison to previous approaches, N-way ANOVA tests were conducted to attest the prowess of the system in the improvement of electrophysiological signals to forthcoming processing and classification stages.

TI Optimising beamformer regions of interest analysis
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB Beamforming is a spatial filtering based source reconstruction method for EEG and MEG that allows the estimation of neuronal activity at a particular location within the brain. The computation of the location specific filter depends solely on an estimate of the data covariance matrix and on the forward model. Increasing the number of M/EEG sensors, increases the quantity of data required for accurate covariance matrix estimation. Often however we have a prior hypothesis about the site of, or the signal of interest. Here we show how this prior specification, in combination with optimal estimations of data dimensionality, can give enhanced beamformer performance for relatively short data segments. Specifically we show how temporal (Bayesian Principal Component Analysis) and spatial (lead field projection) methods can be combined to produce improvements in source estimation over and above employing the approaches individually.

TI Eye blink characterization from frontal EEG electrodes using source
   separation and pattern recognition algorithms
SO BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL
AB Due to its major safety applications, including safe driving, mental fatigue estimation is a rapidly growing research topic in the engineering field. Most current mental fatigue monitoring systems analyze brain activity through electro-encephalography (EEG). Yet eye blink analysis can also be added to help characterize fatigue states. It usually requires the use of additional devices, such as EOG electrodes, uncomfortable to wear, or more expensive eye trackers. However, in this article, a method is proposed to evaluate eye blink parameters using frontal EEG electrodes only. EEG signals, which are generally corrupted by ocular artifacts, are decomposed into sources by means of a source separation algorithm. Sources are then automatically classified into ocular or non-ocular sources using temporal, spatial and frequency features. The selected ocular source is back propagated in the signal space and used to localize blinks by means of an adaptive threshold, and then to characterize detected blinks. The method, validated on 11 different subjects, does not require any prior tuning when applied to a new subject, which makes it subject-independent. The vertical EOG signal was recorded during an experiment lasting 90 min in which the participants' mental fatigue increased. The blinks extracted from this signal were compared to those extracted using frontal EEG electrodes. Very good performances were obtained with a true detection rate of 89% and a false alarm rate of 3%. The correlation between the blink parameters extracted from both recording modalities was 0.81 in average. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI PureEEG: Automatic EEG artifact removal for epilepsy monitoring
SO NEUROPHYSIOLOGIE CLINIQUE-CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB Aim of the study. - A novel method for removal of artifacts from long-term EEGs was developed and evaluated. The method targets most types of artifacts and works without user interaction.
   Materials and methods. - The method is based on a neurophysiological model and utilizes an iterative Bayesian estimation scheme. The performance was evaluated by two independent reviewers. From 48 consecutive epilepsy patients, 102 twenty-second seizure onset EEGs were used to evaluate artifacts before and after artifact removal and regarding the erroneous attenuation of true EEG patterns.
   Results. - The two reviewers found "major improvements" in 59% and 49% of the EEG epochs respectively, and "minor improvements" in 38% and 47% of the epochs, respectively. The answer "similar or worse" was chosen only in 0% and 4%, respectively. Neither of the reviewers found "major attenuations", i.e., a significant attenuation of significant EEG patterns. Most EEG epochs were found to be either "mostly preserved" or "all preserved". A "minor attenuation" was found only in 0% and 17%, respectively.
   Conclusions. - The proposed artifact removal algorithm effectively removes artifacts from EEGs and improves the readability of EEGs impaired by artifacts. Only in rare cases did the algorithm slightly attenuate EEG patterns, but the clear visibility of significant patterns was preserved in all cases of this study. Current artifact removal methods work either semi-automatically or with insufficient reliability for clinical use, whereas the "PureEEG" method works fully automatically and leaves true EEG patterns unchanged with a high reliability.

TI Comparison of magnetic source estimation to intracranial EEG, resection
   area, and seizure outcome
SO EPILEPSIA
AB ObjectivesMagnetoencephalography (MEG) is used to guide intracranial electroencephalography (ICEEG) monitoring and determine areas for resection. The purpose of this retrospective cross-sectional study was to report our experience using dipole modeling/dipole scanning, current density reconstructions, and beam-forming methods in a large cohort of pediatric patients with intractable epilepsy.
   MethodsSource localization results for each algorithm and seizure-onset zone, defined by ICEEG, were described by three blinded reviewers according to five location criteria. The accuracy of each algorithm was then compared to ICEEG. The relationships between the accuracy of these algorithms (discordant, lobar concordant, sublobar concordant) and long-term seizure outcome was calculated using positive and negative predictive values.
   ResultsThirty-two patients (mean age SD, 10.8 +/- 5years) were included in this retrospective review. No algorithms had sublobar concordance with ICEEG in all patients, including when algorithms were grouped by type (dipole modeling/dipole scanning, current density reconstruction, beam forming). Synthetic aperture magnetometry (SAM) with excess kurtosis tended to be the most accurate, but there were no significant differences between algorithms. When comparing the source modeling with ICEEG findings, significantly more patients with a seizure-free outcome were found to have lobar or sublobar concordance of multiple signal classification (MUSIC) (61.1%) and standardized low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) (52.9%). Positive predictive values were highest for MUSIC (61.9%) and equivalent current dipole (ECD) (57.1%). Negative predictive values were highest for SAM(g(2))-VS (83%), minimum norm estimate (MNE) (75%), MUSIC (73.7%), and ECD (73.5%).
   SignificanceThis study describes the use of multiple MEG source estimation techniques and demonstrates that all algorithms have similar rates of concordance with ICEEG. Also, the concordance or discordance of MUSIC with ICEEG was the best predictor of long-term seizure outcome.

TI Estimation of hyper-parameters for a hierarchical model of combined
   cortical and extra-brain current sources in the MEG inverse problem
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB One of the major obstacles in estimating cortical currents from MEG signals is the disturbance caused by magnetic artifacts derived from extra-cortical current sources such as heartbeats and eye movements. To remove the effect of such extra-brain sources, we improved the hybrid hierarchical variational Bayesian method (hyVBED) proposed by Fujiwara et al. (NeuroImage, 2009). hyVBED simultaneously estimates cortical and extra-brain source currents by placing dipoles on cortical surfaces as well as extra-brain sources. This method requires EOG data for an EOG forward model that describes the relationship between eye dipoles and electric potentials. In contrast, our improved approach requires no EOG and less a priori knowledge about the current variance of extra-brain sources. We propose a new method, "extra-dipole," that optimally selects hyper-parameter values regarding current variances of the cortical surface and extra-brain source dipoles. With the selected parameter values, the cortical and extra-brain dipole currents were accurately estimated from the simulated MEG data. The performance of this method was demonstrated to be better than conventional approaches, such as principal component analysis and independent component analysis, which use only statistical properties of MEG signals. Furthermore, we applied our proposed method to measured MEG data during covert pursuit of a smoothly moving target and confirmed its effectiveness. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Improving spatial localization in MEG inverse imaging by leveraging
   intersubject anatomical differences
SO FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE
AB Modern neuroimaging techniques enable non-invasive observation of ongoing neural processing, with magnetoencephalography (MEG) in particular providing direct measurement of neural activity with millisecond time resolution. However, accurately mapping measured MEG sensor readings onto the underlying source neural structures remains an active area of research. This so-called "inverse problem" is ill posed, and poses a challenge for source estimation that is often cited as a drawback limiting MEG data interpretation. However, anatomically constrained MEG localization estimates may be more accurate than commonly believed. Here we hypothesize that, by combining anatomically constrained inverse estimates across subjects, the spatial uncertainty of MEG source localization can be mitigated. Specifically, we argue that differences in subject brain geometry yield differences in point-spread functions, resulting in improved spatial localization across subjects. To test this, we use standard methods to combine subject anatomical MRI scans with coregistration information to obtain an accurate forward (physical) solution, modeling the MEG sensor data resulting from brain activity originating from different cortical locations. Using a linear minimum-norm inverse to localize this brain activity, we demonstrate that a substantial increase in the spatial accuracy of MEG source localization can result from combining data from subjects with differing brain geometry. This improvement may be enabled by an increase in the amount of available spatial information in MEG data as measurements from different subjects are combined. This approach becomes more important in the face of practical issues of coregistration errors and potential noise sources, where we observe even larger improvements in localization when combining data across subjects. Finally, we use a simple auditory N100(m) localization task to show how this effect can influence localization using a recorded neural dataset.

TI Conscious auditory perception related to long-range synchrony of gamma
   oscillations
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB While the role of synchronized oscillatory activity in the gamma-band frequency range for conscious perception is well established in the visual domain, there is limited evidence concerning neurophysiological mechanisms in conscious auditory perception. In the current study, we addressed this issue with 64-channel EEG and a dichotic listening (DL) task in twenty-five healthy participants. The typical finding of DL is a more frequent conscious perception of the speech syllable presented to the right ear (RE), which is attributed to the supremacy of the contralateral pathways running from the RE to the speech-dominant left hemisphere. In contrast, the left ear (LE) input initially accesses the right hemisphere and needs additional transfer via interhemispheric pathways before it is processed in the left hemisphere. Using lagged phase synchronization (LPS) analysis and eLORETA source estimation we examined the functional connectivity between right and left primary and secondary auditory cortices in the main frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma) during RE/LE-reports. Interhemispheric LPS between right and left primary and secondary auditory cortices was specifically increased in the gamma-band range, when participants consciously perceived the syllable presented to the LE. Our results suggest that synchronous gamma oscillations are involved in interhemispheric transfer of auditory information. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI The effect of linear mixing in the EEG on Hurst exponent estimation
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB Although the long-range temporal correlation (LRTC) of the amplitude fluctuations of neuronal EEG/MEG oscillations is widely acknowledged, the majority of studies to date have been performed in sensor space, disregarding the mixing effects implied by volume conduction and confounding noise. While the effect of mixing on the evaluation of evoked responses and connectivity measures has been extensively studied, there are, to date, no studies reporting on the differences in the values of the estimated Hurst exponents when moving between sensor and source space representations of the multivariate data or on the effect of noise. Such differences, if not duly acknowledged, may lead to erroneous data interpretations. We show in simulations and in theory that measuring Hurst exponents in sensor space may lead to an incomplete picture of the LRTC properties of the underlying data and that noise may significantly bias the estimate of the Hurst exponent of the underlying signal. Moreover, these predictions are confirmed in real data, where we analyze the amplitude dynamics of neuronal oscillations in the resting state from EEG data. By moving either to an independent components representation or to a source representation which maximizes the signal to noise ratio in the alpha frequency range, we observe greater variance, skewness and kurtosis over measured Hurst exponents than in sensor space. We confirm the suitability of conventional source separation methodology by. introducing a novel algorithm HeMax which obtains a source maximizing the Hurst exponent in the amplitude dynamics of narrow band oscillations. Our findings imply that the long-range correlative properties of the EEG should be studied in source space, in such a way that the SNR is maximized, or at least with spatial decomposition techniques approximating source activities, rather than in sensor space.

TI Independent component analysis-based method for electroencephalogram
   analysis during photic stimulation
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS
AB Background: Intermittent photic stimulation (IPS) leads to phase- and time-locked activities in the electroencephalogram (EEG). While the first are easily obtained by means of averaging techniques (the evoked response), this latter reflects changes in the ongoing EEG that are important in event-related synchronization/desynchronization (ERS/ERD) studies. Techniques have been proposed for assessing such changes but they only provide the spectral estimate of the time-locked activities.
   New method: An independent component analysis-based method is proposed for the EEG analysis during IPS. Artificially generated sinusoidal functions at the stimulation frequency and harmonics are used together with the acquired EEG signal to build the observed vector that is presented to the ICA algorithm.
   Results: The proposed method was evaluated with simulated data and applied to EEG signals acquired on two electrodes placed over the occipital region showing that this method is capable of providing a suitable estimation of the ongoing EEG activities in both time and frequency domains.
   Comparison with existing method(s): The results were compared with a coherence-based method, showing that the proposed method can estimate the power spectrum of the ongoing EEG activity as precisely as the coherence-based method with the advantage of allowing the ongoing EEG activity in time domain to be also obtained.
   Conclusions: The application of the proposed method could be used for ERS/ERD studies, since it separates evoked responses, which are phase-locked to the stimuli, from those that change the ongoing EEG in a time-locked manner to the external stimulation.

TI Post-switching beta synchronization reveals concomitant sensory
   reafferences and active inhibition processes
SO BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH
AB It is known that post-movement beta synchronization (PMBS) is involved both in active inhibition and in sensory reafferences processes. The aim of this study was examine the temporal and spatial dynamics of the PMBS involved during multi-limb coordination task. We investigated post-switching beta synchronization (assigned PMBS) using time-frequency and source estimations analyzes. Participants (n = 17) initiated an auditory-paced bimanual tapping. After a 1500 ms preparatory period, an imperative stimulus required to either selectively stop the left while maintaining the right unimanual tapping (Switch condition: SWIT) or to continue the bimanual tapping (Continue condition: CONT). PMBS significantly increased in SWIT compared to CONT with maximal difference within right central region in broad-band 14-30 Hz and within left central region in restricted-band 22-26 Hz. Source estimations localized these effects within right pre-frontal cortex and left parietal cortex, respectively. A negative correlation showed that participants with a low percentage of errors in SWIT had a large PMBS amplitude within right parietal and frontal cortices. This study shows for the first time simultaneous PMBS with distinct functions in different brain regions and frequency ranges. The left parietal PMBS restricted to 22-26 Hz could reflect the sensory reafferences of the right hand tapping disrupted by the switching. In contrast, the right prefrontal PMBS in a broad-band 14-30 Hz is likely reflecting the active inhibition of the left hand stopped. Finally, correlations between behavioral performance and the magnitude of the PMBS suggest that beta oscillations can be viewed as a marker of successful active inhibition. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TI Inter- and Intra-Subject Variability of Neuromagnetic Resting State
   Networks
SO BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY
AB Functional connectivity studies conducted at the group level using magnetoencephalography (MEG) suggest that resting state networks (RSNs) emerge from the large-scale envelope correlation structure within spontaneous oscillatory brain activity. However, little is known about the consistency of MEG RSNs at the individual level. This paper investigates the inter- and intra-subject variability of three MEG RSNs (sensorimotor, auditory and visual) using seed-based source space envelope correlation analysis applied to 5 min of resting state MEG data acquired from a 306-channel whole-scalp neuromagnetometer (Elekta Oy, Helsinki, Finland) and source projected with minimum norm estimation. The main finding is that these three MEG RSNs exhibit substantial variability at the single-subject level across and within individuals, which depends on the RSN type, but can be reduced after averaging over subjects or sessions. Over- and under-estimations of true RSNs variability are respectively obtained using template seeds, which are potentially mislocated due to inter-subject variations, and a seed optimization method minimizing variability. In particular, bounds on the minimal number of subjects or sessions required to obtain highly consistent between- or within-subject averages of MEG RSNs are derived. Furthermore, MEG RSN topography positively correlates with their mean connectivity at the inter-subject level. These results indicate that MEG RSNs associated with primary cortices can be robustly extracted from seed-based envelope correlation and adequate averaging. MEG thus appears to be a valid technique to compare RSNs across subjects or conditions, at least when using the current methods.

TI Accuracy of Estimating Strengths of Dipole Moments from a Small Number
   of Magnetoencephalographic Trial Data
SO BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY
AB The conventional analysis estimates both the locations and strengths of neural source activations from event-related magnetoencephalography data that are averaged across about a hundred trials. In the present report, we propose a new method based on a minimum modified-l (1)-norm to obtain the dependence of strengths on the presented stimuli from a limited number of trial data. It estimates the strengths from 10-trial average data and the locations from 100-trial average data. The method can be applied to neural activations whose strengths, but not locations, depend on the presented stimuli. For instance, it can be used in experiments in which the activation in the anterior temporal area (aT) is measured by varying semantic relatedness between stimuli in linguistic experiments. We conducted a realistic simulation, following previous experiments on lexico-semantic processing, in which five neural sources were simultaneously activated. The results showed that when the signal-to-noise ratio was one for non-averaged data, the proposed method had standard deviations of 13 % for the normalized strengths in the aT. It is inferred on the basis of the general linear model in which the strength has a linear dependence on the stimulus parameters that the proposed method can detect the dependence at a significance level of 1 % if the peak-to-peak change in normalized strength is more than 49 %. It is smaller than 66 % for the conventional method, which estimated locations and strengths from 10-trial data for each point. Thus, the proposed method can plot an activation-strength versus stimulus-parameter curve with better sensitivity.

TI Decomposing spatiotemporal brain patterns into topographic latent
   sources
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB This paper extends earlier work on spatial modeling of fMRI data to the temporal domain, providing a framework for analyzing high temporal resolution brain imaging modalities such as electroencapholography (EEG). The central idea is to decompose brain imaging data into a covariate-dependent superposition of functions defined over continuous time and space (what we refer to as topographic latent sources). The continuous formulation allows us to parametrically model spatiotemporally localized activations. To make group-level inferences, we elaborate the model hierarchically by sharing sources across subjects. We describe a variational algorithm for parameter estimation that scales efficiently to large data sets. Applied to three EEG data sets, we find that the model produces good predictive performance and reproduces a number of classic findings. Our results suggest that topographic latent sources serve as an effective hypothesis space for interpreting spatiotemporal brain imaging data. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Spatiotemporal neural dynamics of moral judgment: A high-density ERP
   study
SO NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA
AB Morality is a pervasive aspect of human nature across all cultures, and neuroscience investigations are necessary for identifying what computational mechanisms underpin moral cognition. The current study used high-density ERPs to examine how moral evaluations are mediated by automatic and controlled processes as well as how quickly information and causal-intentional representations can be extracted when viewing morally laden behavior. The study also explored the extent to which individual dispositions in affective and cognitive empathy as well as justice sensitivity influence the encoding of moral valence when healthy participants make moral judgments about prosocial (interpersonal assistance) and antisocial (interpersonal harm) actions. Moral judgment differences were reflected in differential amplitudes for components associated with cognitive appraisal (LPP) as well as early components associated with emotional salience (N1 and N2). Moreover, source estimation was performed to indicate potential neural generators. A posterior-to-anterior shift was observed, with current density peaks first in right inferior parietal cortex (at the temporoparietal junction), then later in medial prefrontal cortex. Cognitive empathy scores predicted behavioral ratings of blame as well as differential amplitudes in LPP and component activity at posterior sites. Overall, this study offers important insights into the temporal unfolding of moral evaluations, including when in time individual differences in empathy influence neural encoding of moral valence.

TI The merit order effect of wind and photovoltaic electricity generation
   in Germany 2008-2016: Estimation and distributional implications
SO ENERGY ECONOMICS
AB Generation from renewable energy sources in Germany has experienced a considerable uptake in recent years. Mainly responsible for this development is the German Renewable Energy Sources Act (Erneuerbare Energien Gesetz, EEG). This paper considers redistributive implications of the EEG for different electricity consumers. Using time-series regression analysis, we show that electricity generation by wind and PV has reduced spot market prices considerably by 6 (sic)/MWh in 2010 rising to 10 (sic)/MWh in 2012. We use these results to build a near-term forecasting tool for merit order effects, projected to reach 14-16 (sic)/MWh in 2016. On the other hand, the costs of the EEG are passed forward to consumers in the form of a surcharge. Our findings highlight significant redistributive transfers under the current design of the EEG. In particular, some energy-intensive industries are benefiting from lower wholesale electricity prices whilst being largely exempted from contributing to the costs of the scheme. We also highlight implications of our results for other areas for reform of the EEG, such as adequate remuneration mechanisms that ensure efficient operation and investment decisions are made under the scheme. More generally, these findings suggest that policy makers need to integrate distributional assessments into policy design and implementation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Voxel-Based Dipole Orientation Constraints for Distributed Current
   Estimation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB Distributed electroencephalography source localization is a highly ill-posed problem. With measurements on the order of 10(2), and unknowns in the range of 10(4) - 10(5), the range of feasible solutions is quite large. One approach to reducing ill-posedness is to intelligently reduce the number of unknowns. Restricting solutions to gray matter is one approach. A further step is to use the anatomy of each patient to identify and constrain the orientation of the dipole within each voxel. While dipole orientation constraints for cortical patch-based approaches have been proposed, to our knowledge, no solutions for full volumetric localizations have been presented. Patch techniques account for patch surface area, but place dipoles only on the surface, rather than throughout the cortex. Variability in human cortical thickness means that thicker regions of cortex will potentially contribute more to the EEG signal, and should be accounted for in modeling. Additionally, patch models require cortical surface identification techniques, which can separate them from the extensive literature on voxel-based MR image processing, and require additional adaptation to incorporate more complex information. We present a volumetric approach for computing voxel-based distributed estimates of cortical activity with constrained dipole orientations. Using a tissue thickness estimation approach, we obtain estimates of the cortical surface normal at each voxel. These let us constrain the inverse problem, and yield localizations with reduced spatial blurring and better identification of signal magnitude within the cortex. This is demonstrated for a series of simulated and experimental data using patient-specific bioelectric models.

TI Functional and effective connectivity of stopping
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB Behavioral inhibition often is studied by comparing the electroencephalographic responses to stop and to go signals. Most studies simply assess amplitude differences of the N200 and P300 event-related potentials, which seem to best correspond to increased activity in the theta and delta frequency bands, respectively. However, neither have reliable indicators for successful behavioral inhibition been identified nor have the causal dependencies of stop-related neurocognitive processes been addressed yet. By studying functional and effective connectivity underlying stopping behavior, this study opens new directions for the investigation of behavioral inhibition. Group independent component analysis was used to infer functionally coherent networks from electroencephalographic data, which were recorded from healthy human participants during processing of a stop signal task. Then, the temporal dynamics of causal dependencies between independent components were identified by means of Bayesian network estimations. The mean clustering coefficient and the characteristic path length measure indicated time windows between 130 and 180 ms and between 420 and 500 ms to express significantly different connectivity profiles between conditions. Three components showed significant correlations between 120 and 260 ms with stop signal reaction times and the number of failed stops. Two of these components acted as sources of causal flow, one capturing P300/delta characteristics while the other was characterized by alpha power depletion putatively representing the evaluation or processing of stimulus features. Although results suggest that the P300 and associated delta activity seem to be statistically dependent on earlier processes associated with behavioral inhibition, the time window critical for inhibition coincides with early changes in causal patterns and largely precedes peak amplitude differences between go and stop trials. Altogether, utilizing the analysis of stopping-related connectivity, previously undetected patterns emerged that warrant further investigation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI A regularized matrix factorization approach to induce structured
   sparse-low-rank solutions in the EEG inverse problem
SO EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING
AB We consider the estimation of the Brain Electrical Sources (BES) matrix from noisy electroencephalographic (EEG) measurements, commonly named as the EEG inverse problem. We propose a new method to induce neurophysiological meaningful solutions, which takes into account the smoothness, structured sparsity, and low rank of the BES matrix. The method is based on the factorization of the BES matrix as a product of a sparse coding matrix and a dense latent source matrix. The structured sparse-low-rank structure is enforced by minimizing a regularized functional that includes the a"" (21)-norm of the coding matrix and the squared Frobenius norm of the latent source matrix. We develop an alternating optimization algorithm to solve the resulting nonsmooth-nonconvex minimization problem. We analyze the convergence of the optimization procedure, and we compare, under different synthetic scenarios, the performance of our method with respect to the Group Lasso and Trace Norm regularizers when they are applied directly to the target matrix.

TI Cortical Source Analysis of High-Density EEG Recordings in Children
SO JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS
AB EEG is traditionally described as a neuroimaging technique with high temporal and low spatial resolution. Recent advances in biophysical modelling and signal processing make it possible to exploit information from other imaging modalities like structural MRI that provide high spatial resolution to overcome this constraint(1). This is especially useful for investigations that require high resolution in the temporal as well as spatial domain. In addition, due to the easy application and low cost of EEG recordings, EEG is often the method of choice when working with populations, such as young children, that do not tolerate functional MRI scans well. However, in order to investigate which neural substrates are involved, anatomical information from structural MRI is still needed. Most EEG analysis packages work with standard head models that are based on adult anatomy. The accuracy of these models when used for children is limited(2), because the composition and spatial configuration of head tissues changes dramatically over development(3).
   In the present paper, we provide an overview of our recent work in utilizing head models based on individual structural MRI scans or age specific head models to reconstruct the cortical generators of high density EEG. This article describes how EEG recordings are acquired, processed, and analyzed with pediatric populations at the London Baby Lab, including laboratory setup, task design, EEG preprocessing, MRI processing, and EEG channel level and source analysis.

TI Electroencephalography-Based Real-Time Cortical Monitoring System That
   Uses Hierarchical Bayesian Estimations for the Brain-Machine Interface
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB In this study, a real-time cortical activity monitoring system was constructed, which could estimate cortical activities every 125 milliseconds over 2,240 vertexes from 64 channel electroencephalography signals through the Hierarchical Bayesian estimation that uses functional magnetic resonance imaging data as its prior information. Recently, functional magnetic resonance imaging has mostly been used in the neurofeedback field because it allows for high spatial resolution. However, in functional magnetic resonance imaging, the time for the neurofeedback information to reach the patient is delayed several seconds because of its poor temporal resolution. Therefore, a number of problems need to be solved to effectively implement feedback training paradigms in patients. To address this issue, this study used a new cortical activity monitoring system that improved both spatial and temporal resolution by using both functional magnetic resonance imaging data and electroencephalography signals in conjunction with one another. This system is advantageous as it can improve applications in the fields of real-time diagnosis, neurofeedback, and the brain-machine interface.

TI The value and cost of complexity in predictive modelling: role of tissue
   anisotropic conductivity and fibre tracts in neuromodulation
SO JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING
AB Objectives. Computational methods are increasingly used to optimize transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) dose strategies and yet complexities of existing approaches limit their clinical access. Since predictive modelling indicates the relevance of subject/pathology based data and hence the need for subject specific modelling, the incremental clinical value of increasingly complex modelling methods must be balanced against the computational and clinical time and costs. For example, the incorporation of multiple tissue layers and measured diffusion tensor (DTI) based conductivity estimates increase model precision but at the cost of clinical and computational resources. Costs related to such complexities aggregate when considering individual optimization and the myriad of potential montages. Here, rather than considering if additional details change current-flow prediction, we consider when added complexities influence clinical decisions. Approach. Towards developing quantitative and qualitative metrics of value/cost associated with computational model complexity, we considered field distributions generated by two 4 x 1 high-definition montages (m1 = 4 x 1 HD montage with anode at C3 and m2 = 4 x 1 HD montage with anode at C1) and a single conventional (m3 = C3-Fp2) tDCS electrode montage. We evaluated statistical methods, including residual error (RE) and relative difference measure (RDM), to consider the clinical impact and utility of increased complexities, namely the influence of skull, muscle and brain anisotropic conductivities in a volume conductor model. Main results. Anisotropy modulated current-flow in a montage and region dependent manner. However, significant statistical changes, produced within montage by anisotropy, did not change qualitative peak and topographic comparisons across montages. Thus for the examples analysed, clinical decision on which dose to select would not be altered by the omission of anisotropic brain conductivity. Significance. Results illustrate the need to rationally balance the role of model complexity, such as anisotropy in detailed current flow analysis versus value in clinical dose design. However, when extending our analysis to include axonal polarization, the results provide presumably clinically meaningful information. Hence the importance of model complexity may be more relevant with cellular level predictions of neuromodulation.

TI Voxel-ICA for reconstruction of source signal time-series and
   orientation in EEG and MEG
SO AUSTRALASIAN PHYSICAL & ENGINEERING SCIENCES IN MEDICINE
AB In electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography signal processing, scalar beamformers are a popular technique for reconstruction of the time-course of a brain source in a single time-series. A prerequisite for scalar beamformers, however, is that the orientation of the source must be known or estimated, whereas in reality the orientation of a brain source is often not known in advance and current techniques for estimation of brain source orientation are effective only for high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) brain sources. As a result, vector beamformers are applied which do not need the orientation of the source and reconstruct the source time-course in three orthogonal (x, y, and z) directions. To obtain a single time-course, the vector magnitude of the three orthogonal outputs of the beamformer can be calculated at each time point (often called neural activity index, NAI). The NAI, however, is different from the actual time-course of a source since it contains only positive values. Moreover, in estimating the magnitude of the desired source, the background activity (undesired signals) in the beamformer outputs also become all positive values, which, when added to each other, leads to a drop in the SNR. This becomes a serious problem when the desired source is weak. We propose applying independent component analysis (ICA) to the orthogonal time-courses of a brain voxel, as reconstructed by a vector beamformer, to reconstruct the time-course of a desired source in a single time-series. This approach also provides a good estimation of dipole orientation. Simulated and real EEG data were used to demonstrate the performance of voxel-ICA and were compared with a scalar beamformer and the magnitude time-series of a vector beamformer. This approach is especially helpful when the desired source is weak and the orientation of the source cannot be estimated by other means.

TI Revealing Time-Unlocked Brain Activity from MEG Measurements by Common
   Waveform Estimation
SO PLOS ONE
AB Brain activities related to cognitive functions, such as attention, occur with unknown and variable delays after stimulus onsets. Recently, we proposed a method (Common Waveform Estimation, CWE) that could extract such brain activities from magnetoencephalography (MEG) or electroencephalography (EEG) measurements. CWE estimates spatiotemporal MEG/EEG patterns occurring with unknown and variable delays, referred to here as unlocked waveforms, without hypotheses about their shapes. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the usefulness of CWE for cognitive neuroscience. For this purpose, we show procedures to estimate unlocked waveforms using CWE and to examine their role. We applied CWE to the MEG epochs during Go trials of a visual Go/NoGo task. This revealed unlocked waveforms with interesting properties, specifically large alpha oscillations around the temporal areas. To examine the role of the unlocked waveform, we attempted to estimate the strength of the brain activity of the unlocked waveform in various conditions. We made a spatial filter to extract the component reflecting the brain activity of the unlocked waveform, applied this spatial filter to MEG data under different conditions (a passive viewing, a simple reaction time, and Go/NoGo tasks), and calculated the powers of the extracted components. Comparing the powers across these conditions suggests that the unlocked waveforms may reflect the inhibition of the task-irrelevant activities in the temporal regions while the subject attends to the visual stimulus. Our results demonstrate that CWE is a potential tool for revealing new findings of cognitive brain functions without any hypothesis in advance.

TI Estimation of direct nonlinear effective connectivity using information
   theory and multilayer perceptron
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS
AB Background: Despite the variety of effective connectivity measures, few methods can quantify direct nonlinear causal couplings and most of them are not applicable to high-dimensional datasets.
   New method: In this paper, a novel approach (called beta mRMR-MLP-GC) is proposed to estimate direct nonlinear effective connectivity of high-dimensional datasets. beta mRMR is used to select a suitable subset of candidate regressors for approximating each neural (here EEG) signal. The multilayer perceptron (MLP) is used for multivariate characterization of EEG signals while the optimum MLP structure is selected using an iterative cross-validation scheme. Finally a causality measure is defined based on Granger Causality (GC) concept to quantify the casual relations among EEG channels.
   Results: Applying beta mRMR-MLP-GC to high-dimensional simulated datasets with different linear and nonlinear structures yields sensitivity and specificity values higher than 95%. Also, applying it to eyes-closed resting state EEG of six normal subjects in the alpha frequency band yields significant net activity propagations from the posterior to anterior brain regions. This is in accordance with the most previous studies in this field.
   Comparison with existing method(s): beta mRMR-MLP-GC is compared with Granger Causality Index, Conditional Granger Causality Index, and Transfer Entropy. It outperforms these methods in terms of sensitivity and specificity in simulated datasets. Also, beta mRMR-MLP-GC detects the most number of significant and reproducible Back-to-Front net information flows among the specified brain regions and highlights the posterior brain regions as dominant source of alpha activity propagation.
   Conclusions: beta mRMR-MLP-GC provides a novel tool to estimate the direct nonlinear causal networks of high-dimensional datasets. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Prefrontal Oscillations during Recall of Conditioned and Extinguished
   Fear in Humans
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE
AB Human neuroimaging studies indicate that the anterior midcingulate cortex (AMC) and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) play important roles in the expression and extinction of fear, respectively. Electrophysiological rodent studies further indicate that oscillatory neuronal activity in homolog regions (i.e., prelimbic and infralimbic cortices) changes during fear expression and fear extinction recall. Whether similar processes occur in humans remains largely unexplored. By assessing scalp surface EEG in conjunction with LORETA source estimation of CS-related theta and gamma activity, we tested whether a priori defined ROIs in the human AMC and vmPFC similarly modulate their oscillatory activity during fear expression and extinction recall, respectively. To this end, 42 healthy individuals underwent a differential conditioning/differential extinction protocol with a Recall Test on the next day. In the Recall Test, nonextinguished versus extinguished stimuli evoked an increased differential (CS+ vs CS-) response with regard to skin conductance and AMC-localized theta power. Conversely, extinguished versus nonextinguished stimuli evoked an increased differential response with regard to vmPFC-localized gamma power. Finally, individuals who failed to show a suppressed skin conductance response to the extinguished versus nonextinguished CS+ also failed to show the otherwise observed alterations in vmPFC gamma power to extinguished CS+. These results indicate that fear expression is associated with AMC theta activity, whereas successful fear extinction recall relates to changes in vmPFC gamma activity. The present work thereby bridges findings from prior rodent electrophysiological research and human neuroimaging studies and indicates that EEG is a valuable tool for future fear extinction research.

TI Optimization of retinotopy constrained source estimation constrained by
   prior
SO HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING
AB Studying how the timing and amplitude of visual evoked responses (VERs) vary between visual areas is important for understanding visual processing but is complicated by difficulties in reliably estimating VERs in individual visual areas using noninvasive brain measurements. Retinotopy constrained source estimation (RCSE) addresses this challenge by using multiple, retinotopically mapped stimulus locations to simultaneously constrain estimates of VERs in visual areas V1, V2, and V3, taking advantage of the spatial precision of fMRI retinotopy and the temporal resolution of magnetoencephalography (MEG) or electroencephalography (EEG). Nonlinear optimization of dipole locations, guided by a group-constrained RCSE solution as a prior, improved the robustness of RCSE. This approach facilitated the analysis of differences in timing and amplitude of VERs between V1, V2, and V3, elicited by stimuli with varying luminance contrast in a sample of eight adult humans. The V1 peak response was 37% larger than that of V2 and 74% larger than that of V3, and also similar to 10-20 ms earlier. Normalized contrast response functions were nearly identical for the three areas. Results without dipole optimization, or with other nonlinear methods not constrained by prior estimates were similar but suffered from greater between-subject variability. The increased reliability of estimates offered by this approach may be particularly valuable when using a smaller number of stimulus locations, enabling a greater variety of stimulus and task manipulations.

TI Decoding spatial attention by using cortical currents estimated from
   electroencephalography with near-infrared spectroscopy prior information
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB For practical brain-machine interfaces (BMIs), electroencephalography (EEG) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) are the only current methods that are non-invasive and available in non-laboratory environments. However, the use of EEG and NIRS involves certain inherent problems. EEG signals are generally a mixture of neural activity from broad areas, some of which may not be related to the task targeted by BMI, hence impairing BMI performance. NIRS has an inherent time delay as it measures blood flow, which therefore detracts from practical real-time BMI utility. To try to improve real environment EEG-NIRS-based BMIs, we propose here a novel methodology in which the subjects' mental states are decoded from cortical currents estimated from EEG, with the help of information from NIRS. Using a Variational Bayesian Multimodal EncephaloGraphy (VBMEG) methodology, we incorporated a novel form of NIRS-based prior to capture event related desynchronization from isolated current sources on the cortical surface. Then, we applied a Bayesian logistic regression technique to decode subjects' mental states from further sparsified current sources. Applying our methodology to a spatial attention task, we found our EEG-NIRS-based decoder exhibited significant performance improvement over decoding methods based on EEG sensor signals alone. The advancement of our methodology, decoding from current sources sparsely isolated on the cortex, was also supported by neuroscientific considerations; intraparietal sulcus, a region known to be involved in spatial attention, was a key responsible region in our task. These results suggest that our methodology is not only a practical option for EEG-NIRS-based BMI applications, but also a potential tool to investigate brain activity in non-laboratory and naturalistic environments.

TI A Framework for the Design of Flexible Cross-Talk Functions for Spatial
   Filtering of EEG/MEG Data: DeFleCT
SO HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING
AB Brain activation estimated from EEG and MEG data is the basis for a number of time-series analyses. In these applications, it is essential to minimize leakage or cross-talk of the estimates among brain areas. Here, we present a novel framework that allows the design of flexible cross-talk functions (DeFleCT), combining three types of constraints: (1) full separation of multiple discrete brain sources, (2) minimization of contributions from other (distributed) brain sources, and (3) minimization of the contribution from measurement noise. Our framework allows the design of novel estimators by combining knowledge about discrete sources with constraints on distributed source activity and knowledge about noise covariance. These estimators will be useful in situations where assumptions about sources of interest need to be combined with uncertain information about additional sources that may contaminate the signal (e.g. distributed sources), and for which existing methods may not yield optimal solutions. We also show how existing estimators, such as maximum-likelihood dipole estimation, L2 minimum-norm estimation, and linearly-constrained minimum variance as well as null-beamformers, can be derived as special cases from this general formalism. The performance of the resulting estimators is demonstrated for the estimation of discrete sources and regions-of-interest in simulations of combined EEG/MEG data. Our framework will be useful for EEG/MEG studies applying time-series analysis in source space as well as for the evaluation and comparison of linear estimators. Hum Brain Mapp 35:1642-1653, 2014.

TI Potential use of MEG to understand abnormalities in auditory function in
   clinical populations
SO FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE
AB Magnetoencephalography (MEG) provides a direct, non-invasive view of neural activity with millisecond temporal precision. Recent developments in MEG analysis allow for improved source localization and mapping of connectivity between brain regions, expanding the possibilities for using MEG as a diagnostic tool. In this paper, we first describe inverse imaging methods (e.g., minimum-norm estimation) and functional connectivity measures, and how they can provide insights into cortical processing. We then offer a perspective on how these techniques could be used to understand and evaluate auditory pathologies that often manifest during development. Here we focus specifically on how MEG inverse imaging, by providing anatomically based interpretation of neural activity, may allow us to test which aspects of cortical processing play a role in (central) auditory processing disorder [(C)APD]. Appropriately combining auditory paradigms with MEG analysis could eventually prove useful for a hypothesis-driven understanding and diagnosis of (C)APD or other disorders, as well as the evaluation of the effectiveness of intervention strategies.

TI SCoT: a Python toolbox for EEG source connectivity
SO FRONTIERS IN NEUROINFORMATICS
AB Analysis of brain connectivity has become an important research tool in neuroscience. Connectivity can be estimated between cortical sources reconstructed from the electroencephalogram (EEG). Such analysis often relies on trial averaging to obtain reliable results. However, some applications such as brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) require single-trial estimation methods. In this paper, we present SCoT-a source connectivity toolbox for Python. This toolbox implements routines for blind source decomposition and connectivity estimation with the MVARICA approach. Additionally, a novel extension called CSPVARICA is available for labeled data. SCoT estimates connectivity from various spectral measures relying on vector autoregressive (VAR) models. Optionally, these VAR models can be regularized to facilitate ill posed applications such as single-trial fitting. We demonstrate basic usage of SCoT on motor imagery (MI) data. Furthermore, we show simulation results of utilizing SCoT for feature extraction in a BCI application. These results indicate that CSPVARICA and correct regularization can significantly improve MI classification. While SCoT was mainly designed for application in BCIs, it contains useful tools for other areas of neuroscience. SCoT is a software package that (1) brings combined source decomposition and connectivtiy estimation to the open Python platform, and (2) offers tools for single-trial connectivity estimation. The source code is released under the MIT license and is available online at github.com/SCoT-dev/SCoT.

TI A Variational Bayes Spatiotemporal Model for Electromagnetic Brain
   Mapping
SO BIOMETRICS
AB In this article, we present a new variational Bayes approach for solving the neuroelectromagnetic inverse problem arising in studies involving electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). This high-dimensional spatiotemporal estimation problem involves the recovery of time-varying neural activity at a large number of locations within the brain, from electromagnetic signals recorded at a relatively small number of external locations on or near the scalp. Framing this problem within the context of spatial variable selection for an underdetermined functional linear model, we propose a spatial mixture formulation where the profile of electrical activity within the brain is represented through location-specific spike-and-slab priors based on a spatial logistic specification. The prior specification accommodates spatial clustering in brain activation, while also allowing for the inclusion of auxiliary information derived from alternative imaging modalities, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We develop a variational Bayes approach for computing estimates of neural source activity, and incorporate a nonparametric bootstrap for interval estimation. The proposed methodology is compared with several alternative approaches through simulation studies, and is applied to the analysis of a multimodal neuroimaging study examining the neural response to face perception using EEG, MEG, and fMRI.

TI High and Low Stimulus-Driven Conflict Engage Segregated Brain Networks,
   Not Quantitatively Different Resources
SO BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY
AB Task-irrelevant information is constantly present in our environment and may interfere with the processing of the information necessary to achieve goal-directed behavior. While task goals determine which information must be suppressed, the demand for inhibitory control depends on the strength of the interference induced by incoming, task-irrelevant information. Whether the same or distinct inhibitory processes are engaged to suppress various degrees of interference from task-irrelevant information remains largely unresolved. We investigated this question by manipulating the strength of the conflict induced by automatic word reading in a classical color Stroop task. High conflict was induced by presenting words in participant's native language and low conflict by presenting words in a less familiar language. Behavioral performance and electrical neuroimaging analyses of event-related potentials to the words were analyzed following a two-by-two within-subject design with factors conflict strength (high; low) and color word/word ink congruency (congruent; incongruent). Behaviorally, we observed a significant conflict strength x congruency driven by a smaller Stroop effect in the low- than high conflict condition. Electrophysiologically, we observed a significant conflict strength x congruency interaction at the topographic level during the period of the N450 components, indicative of the engagement of distinct configurations of brain networks. No such interaction was found at the level of response strength. Electrical sources analyses localized the topographic effect within the anterior cingulate cortex and basal ganglia, left middle frontal and occipital areas. We interpret our results in terms of qualitatively distinct executive mechanisms for reactive inhibitory control in conditions of high versus low stimulus-driven conflict.

TI A Single-Trial Estimation of the Feedback-Related Negativity and Its
   Relation to BOLD Responses in a Time-Estimation Task
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE
AB An event-related potential (ERP) component reliably associated with feedback processing and well studied in humans is the feedback-related negativity (FRN), which is assumed to indicate activation of midcingulate cortex (MCC) neurons. However, recent approaches have conceptualized this frontocentral ERP component as reflecting at least partially a reward positivity associated with activation in reward-related brain regions, in line with fMRI studies investigating feedback processing in the context of reward evaluation. To discover convergence of electrophysiological and BOLD responses elicited by performance feedback, we concurrently recorded EEG and fMRI during a time-estimation task. The ERP showed relatively more negative amplitudes to negative than to positive feedback. Conventional analyses of fMRI data revealed activation of a number of areas, including ventral striatum, anterior cingulate cortex, and medial prefrontal cortex to positive versus negative feedback. Most importantly, when using single-trial amplitudes of electrophysiological feedback signals to estimate hemodynamic responses, we found feedback-related BOLD-responses in ventral striatum, midcingulate, and midfrontal cortices to positive but not to negative feedback associated with feedback signals in the time range of the FRN. Specifically, activation in these areas increased as amplitudes became more positive. These findings suggest that, in the time-estimation task, a positivity elicited by reward is associated with brain activation in several reward-related brain regions and is driving differential ERP responses in the time range of the FRN.

TI Early attentional processes distinguish selective from global motor
   inhibitory control: An electrical neuroimaging study
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB The rapid stopping of specific parts of movements is frequently required in daily life. Yet, whether selective inhibitory control of movements is mediated by a specific neural pathway or by the combination between a global stopping of all ongoing motor activity followed by the re-initiation of task-relevant movements remains unclear. To address this question, we applied time-wise statistical analyses of the topography, global field power and electrical sources of the event-related potentials to the global vs selective inhibition stimuli presented during a Go/NoGo task. Participants (n = 18) had to respond as fast as possible with their two hands to Go stimuli and to withhold the response from the two hands (global inhibition condition, GNG) or from only one hand (selective inhibition condition, SNG) when specific NoGo stimuli were presented. Behaviorally, we replicated previous evidence for slower response times in the SNG than in the Go condition. Electrophysiologically, there were two distinct phases of event-related potentials modulations between the GNG and the SNG conditions. At 110-150 ms post-stimulus onset, there was a difference in the strength of the electric field without concomitant topographic modulation, indicating the differential engagement of statistically indistinguishable configurations of neural generators for selective and global inhibitory control. At 150-200 ms, there was topographic modulation, indicating the engagement of distinct brain networks. Source estimations localized these effects within bilateral temporo-parieto-occipital and within parieto-central networks, respectively. Our results suggest that while both types of motor inhibitory control depend on global stopping mechanisms, selective and global inhibition still differ quantitatively at early attention-related processing phases.

TI Cortical surface alignment in multi-subject spatiotemporal independent
   EEG source imaging
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB Brain responses to stimulus presentations may vary widely across subjects in both time course and spatial origins. Multi-subject EEG source imaging studies that apply Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to data concatenated across subjects have overlooked the fact that projections to the scalp sensors from functionally equivalent cortical sources vary from subject to subject. This study demonstrates an approach to spatiotemporal independent component decomposition and alignment that spatially co-registers the MR-derived cortical topographies of individual subjects to a well-defined, shared spherical topology (Fischl et al., 1999). Its efficacy for identifying functionally equivalent EEG sources in multi-subject analysis is demonstrated by analyzing EEG and behavioral data from a stop-signal paradigm using two source-imaging approaches, both based on individual subject independent source decompositions. The first, two-stage approach uses temporal infomax ICA to separate each subject's data into temporally independent components (ICs), then estimates the source density distribution of each IC process from its scalp map and clusters similar sources across subjects (Makeig et al., 2002). The second approach, Electromagnetic Spatiotemporal Independent Component Analysis (EMSICA), combines ICA decomposition and source current density estimation of the artifact-rejected data into a single spatiotemporal ICA decomposition for each subject (Tsai et al., 2006), concurrently identifying both the spatial source distribution of each cortical source and its event-related dynamics. Applied to the stop-signal task data, both approaches gave IC clusters that separately accounted for EEG processes expected in stop-signal tasks, including pre/ postcentral mu rhythms, anterior-cingulate theta rhythm, and right-inferior frontal responses, the EMSICA clusters exhibiting more tightly correlated source areas and time-frequency features.

TI Non-Gaussian probabilistic MEG source localisation based on kernel
   density estimation
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB There is strong evidence to suggest that data recorded from magnetoencephalography (MEG) follows a nonGaussian distribution. However, existing standard methods for source localisation model the data using only second order statistics, and therefore use the inherent assumption of a Gaussian distribution. In this paper, we present a new general method for non-Gaussian source estimation of stationary signals for localising brain activity from MEG data. By providing a Bayesian formulation for MEG source localisation, we show that the source probability density function (pdf), which is not necessarily Gaussian, can be estimated using multivariate kernel density estimators. In the case of Gaussian data, the solution of the method is equivalent to that of widely used linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamformer. The method is also extended to handle data with highly correlated sources using the marginal distribution of the estimated joint distribution, which, in the case of Gaussian measurements, corresponds to the null-beamformer. The proposed non-Gaussian source localisation approach is shown to give better spatial estimates than the LCMV beamformer, both in simulations incorporating non-Gaussian signals, and in real MEG measurements of auditory and visual evoked responses, where the highly correlated sources are known to be difficult to estimate.

TI Age-related changes in the bimanual advantage and in brain oscillatory
   activity during tapping movements suggest a decline in processing
   sensory reafference
SO EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH
AB Deficits in the processing of sensory reafferences have been suggested as accounting for age-related decline in motor coordination. Whether sensory reafferences are accurately processed can be assessed based on the bimanual advantage in tapping: because of tapping with an additional hand increases kinesthetic reafferences, bimanual tapping is characterized by a reduced inter-tap interval variability than unimanual tapping. A suppression of the bimanual advantage would thus indicate a deficit in sensory reafference. We tested whether elderly indeed show a reduced bimanual advantage by measuring unimanual (UM) and bimanual (BM) self-paced tapping performance in groups of young (n = 29) and old (n = 27) healthy adults. Electroencephalogram was recorded to assess the underlying patterns of oscillatory activity, a neurophysiological mechanism advanced to support the integration of sensory reafferences. Behaviorally, there was a significant interaction between the factors tapping condition and age group at the level of the inter-tap interval variability, driven by a lower variability in BM than UM tapping in the young, but not in the elderly group. This result indicates that in self-paced tapping, the bimanual advantage is absent in elderly. Electrophysiological results revealed an interaction between tapping condition and age group on low beta band (14-20 Hz) activity. Beta activity varied depending on the tapping condition in the elderly but not in the young group. Source estimations localized this effect within left superior parietal and left occipital areas. We interpret our results in terms of engagement of different mechanisms in the elderly depending on the tapping mode: a 'kinesthetic' mechanism for UM and a 'visual imagery' mechanism for BM tapping movement.

TI Reconstructing spatially extended brain sources via enforcing multiple
   transform sparseness
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB Accurate estimation of location and extent of neuronal sources from EEG/MEG remain challenging. In the present study, a new source imaging method, i.e. variation and wavelet based sparse source imaging (VW-SSI), is proposed to better estimate cortical source locations and extents. VW-SSI utilizes the Ll-norm regularization method with the enforcement of transform sparseness in both variation and wavelet domains. The performance of the proposed method is assessed by both simulated and experimental MEG data, obtained from a language task and a motor task. Compared to L2-norm regularizations, VW-SSI demonstrates significantly improved capability in reconstructing multiple extended cortical sources with less spatial blurredness and less localization error. With the use of transform sparseness, VW-SSI overcomes the over-focused problem in classic SSI methods. With the use of two transformations, VW-SSI further indicates significantly better performance in estimating MEG source locations and extents than other SSI methods with single transformations. The present experimental results indicate that VW-SSI can successfully estimate neural sources (and their spatial coverage) located in close areas while responsible for different functions, i.e. temporal cortical sources for auditory and language processing, and sources on the pre-bank and post-bank of the central sulcus. Meantime, all other methods investigated in the present study fail to recover these phenomena. Precise estimation of cortical source locations and extents from EEG/MEG is of significance for applications in neuroscience and neurology. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

MNE, whose name stems from its capability to compute conically-constrained minimum-norm current estimates from M/EEG data, is a software package that provides comprehensive analysis tools and workflows including preprocessing, source estimation, time-frequency analysis, statistical analysis, and several methods to estimate functional connectivity between distributed brain regions. The present paper gives detailed information about the MNE package and describes typical use cases while also warning about potential caveats in analysis. The MNE package is a collaborative effort of multiple institutes striving to implement and share best methods and to facilitate distribution of analysis pipelines to advance reproducibility of research.

TI Analysis the effect of PCA for feature reduction in non-stationary EEG
   based motor imagery of BCI system
SO OPTIK
AB Many brain computer-interface (BCI) systems depend on imagined movement to control external devices. But how to extract the imagination feature and classify them to control systems is an important problem. To simplify the complexity of the classification, the power band and a small number of electrodes have been used, but there is still a loss in classification accuracy in the state-of-art approaches. The critical problem is the machine learning art that when the signal into source has property of non-stationary causing the estimation of the population parameter to change over time. In this paper, we analyzed the performance of feature extraction method using several spatial filter such as common average reference (CAR), Laplacian (LAP), common spatial pattern analysis (CSP) and no-spatial filter techniques and feature reduction method using principle component analysis (PCA) based 90% rule variance and leave-one-out correct classification accuracy selection method; where support vector machine is the classifier. The simulation with non-stationary data set from BCI competition III-Iva shows that CAR best performance CSP method in non-stationary data and PCA with leave-one-out CCA could maintain CCA performance and reduced the trading off between training and testing 13.96% compared to not using PCA and 0.46% compared PCA with 90% variance.

TI Influence of Skull Modeling Approaches on EEG Source Localization
SO BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY
AB Electroencephalographic source localization (ESL) relies on an accurate model representing the human head for the computation of the forward solution. In this head model, the skull is of utmost importance due to its complex geometry and low conductivity compared to the other tissues inside the head. We investigated the influence of using different skull modeling approaches on ESL. These approaches, consisting in skull conductivity and geometry modeling simplifications, make use of X-ray computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) images to generate seven different head models. A head model with an accurately segmented skull from CT images, including spongy and compact bone compartments as well as some air-filled cavities, was used as the reference model. EEG simulations were performed for a configuration of 32 and 128 electrodes, and for both noiseless and noisy data. The results show that skull geometry simplifications have a larger effect on ESL than those of the conductivity modeling. This suggests that accurate skull modeling is important in order to achieve reliable results for ESL that are useful in a clinical environment. We recommend the following guidelines to be taken into account for skull modeling in the generation of subject-specific head models: (i) If CT images are available, i.e., if the geometry of the skull and its different tissue types can be accurately segmented, the conductivity should be modeled as isotropic heterogeneous. The spongy bone might be segmented as an erosion of the compact bone; (ii) when only MR images are available, the skull base should be represented as accurately as possible and the conductivity can be modeled as isotropic heterogeneous, segmenting the spongy bone directly from the MR image; (iii) a large number of EEG electrodes should be used to obtain high spatial sampling, which reduces the localization errors at realistic noise levels.

TI The primary somatosensory cortex contributes to the latest part of the
   cortical response elicited by nociceptive somatosensory stimuli in
   humans
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB Nociceptive laser pulses elicit temporally-distinct cortical responses (the N1, N2 and P2 waves of laser-evoked potentials, LEPs) mainly reflecting the activity of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) contralateral to the stimulated side, and of the bilateral operculoinsular and cingulate cortices. Here, by performing two different EEG experiments and applying a range of analysis approaches (microstate analysis, scalp topography, single-trial estimation), we describe a distinct component in the last part of the human LEP response (P4 wave). We obtained three main results. First, the LEP is reliably decomposed in four main and distinct functional microstates, corresponding to the N1, N2, P2, and P4 waves, regardless of stimulus territory. Second, the scalp and source configurations of the P4 wave follow a clear somatotopical organization, indicating that this response is likely to be partly generated in contralateral Sl. Third, single-trial latencies and amplitudes of the P4 are tightly coupled with those of the N1, and are similarly sensitive to experimental manipulations (e.g., to crossing the hands over the body midline), suggesting that the P4 and N1 may have common neural sources. These results indicate that the P4 wave is a clear and distinct LEP component, which should be considered in LEP studies to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the brain response to nociceptive stimulation.

TI Assessment of Electric Field Distribution in Anisotropic Cortical and
   Subcortical Regions Under the Influence of tDCS
SO BIOELECTROMAGNETICS
AB The focus of this study is to estimate the contribution of regional anisotropic conductivity on the spatial distribution of an induced electric field across gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and subcortical regions under transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). The assessment was conducted using a passive high-resolution finite element head model with inhomogeneous and variable anisotropic conductivities derived from the diffusion tensor data. Electric field distribution was evaluated across different cortical as well as subcortical regions under four bicephalic electrode configurations. Results indicate that regional tissue heterogeneity and anisotropy cause the pattern of induced fields to vary in orientation and strength when compared to the isotropic scenario. Different electrode montages resulted in distinct distribution patterns with noticeable variations in field strengths. The effect of anisotropy is highly montage dependent and directional conductivity has a more profound effect in defining the strength of the induced field. The inclusion of anisotropy in the GM and subcortical regions has a significant effect on the strength and spatial distribution of the induced electric field. Under the (C3-Fp2) montage, the inclusion of GM and subcortical anisotropy increased the average percentage difference in the electric field strength of brain from 5% to 34% (WM anisotropy only). In terms of patterns distribution, the topographic errors increased from 9.9% to 40% (WM anisotropy only) across the brain. Bioelectromagnetics. 35:41-57, 2014. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Is love right? Prefrontal resting brain asymmetry is related to the
   affiliation motive
SO FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE
AB Previous research on relationships between affective-motivational traits and hemispheric asymmetries in resting frontal alpha band power as measured by electroencephalography (EEG) focused on individual differences in motivational direction (approach vs. withdrawal) or behavioral activation. The present study investigated resting frontal alpha asymmetries in 72 participants as a function of individual differences in the implicit affiliation motive as measured with the operant motive test (OMT) and explored the brain source thereof. Decreased relative right frontal activity as indexed by increased alpha band power was related to low levels of the implicit affiliation motive. No relationships were found for explicit personality measures. Intracranial current density distributions of alpha based on Variable Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (VARETA) source estimations suggests that the source of cortical alpha distribution is located within the right ventromedial prefrontal cortex (PFC). The present results are discussed with respect to differential roles of the two hemispheres in social motivation.

TI Reconstructing Coherent Networks from Electroencephalography and
   Magnetoencephalography with Reduced Contamination from Volume Conduction
   or Magnetic Field Spread
SO PLOS ONE
AB Volume conduction (VC) and magnetic field spread (MFS) induce spurious correlations between EEG/MEG sensors, such that the estimation of functional networks from scalp recordings is inaccurate. Imaginary coherency [1] reduces VC/MFS artefacts between sensors by assuming that instantaneous interactions are caused predominantly by VC/MFS and do not contribute to the imaginary part of the cross-spectral densities (CSDs). We propose an adaptation of the dynamic imaging of coherent sources (DICS) [2] - a method for reconstructing the CSDs between sources, and subsequently inferring functional connectivity based on coherences between those sources. Firstly, we reformulate the principle of imaginary coherency by performing an eigenvector decomposition of the imaginary part of the CSD to estimate the power that only contributes to the non-zero phase-lagged (NZPL) interactions. Secondly, we construct an NZPL-optimised spatial filter with two a priori assumptions: (1) that only NZPL interactions exist at the source level and (2) the NZPL CSD at the sensor level is a good approximation of the projected source NZPL CSDs. We compare the performance of the NZPL method to the standard method by reconstructing a coherent network from simulated EEG/MEG recordings. We demonstrate that, as long as there are phase differences between the sources, the NZPL method reliably detects the underlying networks from EEG and MEG. We show that the method is also robust to very small phase lags, noise from phase jitter, and is less sensitive to regularisation parameters. The method is applied to a human dataset to infer parts of a coherent network underpinning face recognition.

TI Performance of different metaheuristics in EEG source localization
   compared to the Cramer-Rao bound
SO NEUROCOMPUTING
AB The problem of electroencephalographic (EEG) source localization involves an optimization process that can be solved through metaheuristics. In this paper, we evaluate the performance in localizing EEG dipole sources using simulated annealing (SA), genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and differential evolution (DE). The evaluation is performed in terms of the metaheuristics' operational parameters and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Here, the objective function in the optimization problem is the concentrated likelihood function (CLF), while the Cramer-Rao bound is proposed as benchmark. Under these conditions, the metaheuristics' best performances are achieved when the variance of their corresponding dipole source estimates is close to the CRB. Therefore, we exhaustively evaluate the variances of the source estimates obtained through each metaheuristic for the case of realistically simulated EEG data. Our results showed that no significant variations on the performance were introduced by changes in the metaheuristics' operational parameters, specially in one-dipole estimation. For two-dipole estimation, the performance of GA and DE was better than in other metaheuristics, but DE required a fine adjustment of its parameters in order to work. In all cases, the performance decayed as the SNR decreased, while SA and PSO seemed to be very sensitive to the correlation between the sources. Overall, GA was the most attractive technique in terms of performance and computational cost. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Functional brain network organisation of children between 2 and 5 years
   derived from reconstructed activity of cortical sources of high-density
   EEG recordings
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB There is increasing interest in applying connectivity analysis to brain measures (Rubinov and Sporns, 2010), but most studies have relied on fMRI, which substantially limits the participant groups and numbers that can be studied. High-density EEG recordings offer a comparatively inexpensive easy-to-use alternative, but require channel-level connectivity analysis which currently lacks a common analytic framework and is very limited in spatial resolution. To address this problem, we have developed a new technique for studies of network development that overcomes the spatial constraint and obtains functional networks of cortical areas by using EEG source reconstruction with age-matched average MRI templates (He et al., 1999). In contrast to previously reported channel-level analysis, this approach provides information about the cortical areas most likely to be involved in the network as well as their functional relationship (Babiloni et al., 2005; De Vico Fallani et al., 2007).
   In this study, we applied source reconstruction with age-matched templates to task-free high-density EEG recordings in typically-developing children between 2 and 6 years of age (O'Reilly, 2012). Graph theory was then applied to the association strengths of 68 cortical regions of interest based on the Desikan-Killiany atlas. We found linear increases of mean node degree, mean clustering coefficient and maximum betweenness centrality between 2 years and 6 years of age. Characteristic path length was negatively correlated with age. The correlation of the network measures with age indicates network development towards more closely integrated networks similar to reports from other imaging modalities (Fair et al., 2008; Power et al., 2010). We also applied eigenvalue decomposition to obtain functional modules (Clayden et al., 2013). Connection strength within these modules did not change with age, and the modules resembled hub networks previously described for MRI (Hagmann et al., 2010; Power et al., 2010). The high temporal resolution of EEG additionally allowed us to distinguish between frequency bands potentially reflecting dynamic coupling between different neural oscillators. Generally, network parameters were similar for networks based on different frequency bands, but frequency band did emerge as a significant factor for clustering coefficient and characteristic path length. In conclusion, the current analysis shows that source reconstruction of high-density EEG recordings with appropriate head models offers a valuable tool for estimating network parameters in studies of brain development. The findings replicate the pattern of closer functional integration over development described for other imaging modalities (Fair et al., 2008; Power et al., 2010).

TI Dipole Source Localization of Mouse Electroencephalogram Using the
   Fieldtrip Toolbox
SO PLOS ONE
AB The mouse model is an important research tool in neurosciences to examine brain function and diseases with genetic perturbation in different brain regions. However, the limited techniques to map activated brain regions under specific experimental manipulations has been a drawback of the mouse model compared to human functional brain mapping. Here, we present a functional brain mapping method for fast and robust in vivo brain mapping of the mouse brain. The method is based on the acquisition of high density electroencephalography (EEG) with a microarray and EEG source estimation to localize the electrophysiological origins. We adapted the Fieldtrip toolbox for the source estimation, taking advantage of its software openness and flexibility in modeling the EEG volume conduction. Three source estimation techniques were compared: Distribution source modeling with minimum-norm estimation (MNE), scanning with multiple signal classification (MUSIC), and single-dipole fitting. Known sources to evaluate the performance of the localization methods were provided using optogenetic tools. The accuracy was quantified based on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The mean detection accuracy was high, with a false positive rate less than 1.3% and 7% at the sensitivity of 90% plotted with the MNE and MUSIC algorithms, respectively. The mean center-to-center distance was less than 1.2 mm in single dipole fitting algorithm. Mouse microarray EEG source localization using microarray allows a reliable method for functional brain mapping in awake mouse opening an access to cross-species study with human brain.

TI A general framework to estimate spatial and spatio-spectral filters for
   EEG signal classification
SO NEUROCOMPUTING
AB In this paper, a general framework is proposed for simultaneous design of spatial and spectral filters, which are used to extract discriminant features from EEG signals in Brain Computer Interfacing (BCI) systems. This paper introduces Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) as a step-by-step filter optimization algorithm, and then proposes a generalized type of the CSP which is not limited in a specific optimization constraint. Moreover, it is shown that how this generalization can be extended to a spatio-spectral filter estimation scheme. Then, two specific versions of the generalized CSP are proposed, where a specific target function and optimization constraint are used for estimating the spatial and spectral filters. Unlike the traditional CSP which is not very closely linked to the classification accuracy, the proposed algorithms are able to be more directly aimed at achieving better accuracy and stability. Experimental results obtained from applying the introduced methods on the recorded imagery signals from two datasets, demonstrate considerable improvement in the classification accuracy and stability compared to the standard CSP and other similar methods.

TI Analysis of parametric estimation of head tissue conductivities using
   Electrical Impedance Tomography
SO BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL
AB We study the theoretical performance of using Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) to measure the conductivity of the main tissues of the head. The governing equations are solved using the Finite Element Method for realistically shaped head models with isotropic and anisotropic electrical conductivities. We focus on the Electroencephalography (EEG) signal frequency range since EEG source localization is the assumed application. We obtain the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) to find the minimum conductivity estimation error expected with EIT measurements. The more convenient electrode pairs selected for current injection from a typical EEG array are determined from the CRLB. Moreover, using simulated data, the Maximum Likelihood Estimator of the conductivity parameters is shown to be close to the CRLB for a relatively low number of measurements. The results support the idea of using EIT as a low-cost and practical tool for individually measure the conductivity of the head tissues, and to use them when solving the EEG source localization. Even when the conductivity of the soft tissues of the head is available from Diffusion Tensor Imaging, EIT can complement the electrical model with the estimation of the skull and scalp conductivities.

TI Estimating the Passage of Minutes: Deviant Oscillatory Frontal Activity
   in Medicated and Unmedicated ADHD
SO NEUROPSYCHOLOGY
AB Objective: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common and extensively treated psychiatric disorder in children, which often persists into adulthood. The core diagnostic symptoms include inappropriate levels of hyperactivity, impulsivity, and/or pervasive inattention. Another crucial aspect of the disorder involves aberrations in temporal perception, which have been well documented in behavioral studies and, recently, have been the focus of neuroimaging studies. These functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown reduced activation in anterior cingulate and prefrontal cortices in ADHD using a time-interval discrimination task, whereby participants distinguish intervals differing by only hundreds of milliseconds. Method: We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to evaluate the cortical network serving temporal perception during a continuous, long-duration (in minutes) time estimation experiment. Briefly, medicated and unmedicated persons with ADHD, and a control group responded each time they estimated 60 s had elapsed for an undisclosed amount of time in two separate MEG sessions. All MEG data were transformed into regional source activity, and subjected to spectral analyses to derive amplitude estimates of gamma-band activity. Results: Compared to controls, unmedicated patients were less accurate time estimators and had weaker gamma activity in the anterior cingulate, supplementary motor area, and left prefrontal cortex. After medication, these patients exhibited small but significant increases in gamma across these same neural regions and significant improvements in time estimation accuracy, which correlated with the gamma activity increases. Conclusion: We found deficient gamma activity in brain areas known to be crucial for timing functions, which may underlie the day-to-day abnormalities in time perception that are common in ADHD.

TI Minimum-norm cortical source estimation in layered head models is robust
   against skull conductivity error
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB The conductivity profile of the head has a major effect on EEG signals, but unfortunately the conductivity for the most important compartment, skull, is only poorly known. In dipole modeling studies, errors in modeled skull conductivity have been considered to have a detrimental effect on EEG source estimation. However, as dipole models are very restrictive, those results cannot be generalized to other source estimation methods. In this work, we studied the sensitivity of EEG and combined MEG + EEG source estimation to errors in skull conductivity using a distributed source model and minimum-norm (MN) estimation.
   We used a MEG/EEG modeling set-up that reflected state-of-the-art practices of experimental research. Cortical surfaces were segmented and realistically-shaped three-layer anatomical head models were constructed, and forward models were built with Galerkin boundary element method while varying the skull conductivity. Lead-field topographies and MN spatial filter vectors were compared across conductivities, and the localization and spatial spread of the MN estimators were assessed using intuitive resolution metrics. The results showed that the MN estimator is robust against errors in skull conductivity: the conductivity had a moderate effect on amplitudes of lead fields and spatial filter vectors, but the effect on corresponding morphologies was small. The localization performance of the EEG or combined MEG + EEG MN estimator was only minimally affected by the conductivity error, while the spread of the estimate varied slightly. Thus, the uncertainty with respect to skull conductivity should not prevent researchers from applying minimum norm estimation to EEG or combined MEG + EEG data. Comparing our results to those obtained earlier with dipole models shows that general judgment on the performance of an imaging modality should not be based on analysis with one source estimation method only.

TI BLIND SIGNAL SEPARATION OF MIXTURES OF CHAOTIC PROCESSES: A COMPARISON
   BETWEEN INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS AND STATE SPACE MODELING
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIFURCATION AND CHAOS
AB We perform a systematic comparison between different algorithms for solving the Blind Signal Separation problem. In particular, we compare five well-known algorithms for Independent Component Analysis (ICA) with a recently proposed algorithm based on linear state space modeling (IC-LSS). The comparison is based on simulated mixtures of six source signals, five of which are generated by nonlinear deterministic processes evolving on chaotic attractors. The quality of the reconstructed sources is quantified by two measures, one based on a distance measure implemented by a Frobenius norm, and one based on residual mutual information. We find that the IC-LSS modeling algorithm offers several advantages over the ICA algorithms: it succeeds in unmixing Gaussian sources, on short time series it performs, on average, better than static ICA algorithms, it does not try to remove coincidental dependencies resulting from finite data set size, and it shows the potential to reconstruct the sources even in the case of noninvertible mixing. As expected, for the case of non-Gaussian sources, invertible mixing and sufficient time series length, the ICA algorithms typically outperform IC-LSS modeling.

TI Cortical Graph Smoothing: A Novel Method for Exploiting DWI-Derived
   Anatomical Brain Connectivity to Improve EEG Source Estimation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING
AB The electroencephalography source estimation problem consists of inferring cortical activation from measurements of electrical potential taken on the scalp surface. This inverse problem is intrinsically ill-posed. In particular the dimensionality of cortical sources greatly exceeds the number of electrode measurements, and source estimation requires regularization to obtain a unique solution. In this work, we introduce a novel regularization function called cortical graph smoothing, which exploits knowledge of anatomical connectivity available from diffusion-weighted imaging. Given a weighted graph description of the anatomical connectivity of the brain, cortical graph smoothing penalizes the weighted sum of squares of differences of cortical activity across the graph edges, thus encouraging solutions with consistent activation across anatomically connected regions. We explore the performance of the cortical graph smoothing source estimates for analysis of the event related potential for simple motor tasks, and compare against the commonly used minimum norm, weighted minimum norm, LORETA and sLORETA source estimation methods. Evaluated over a series of 18 subjects, the proposed cortical graph smoothing method shows superior localization accuracy compared to the minimum norm method, and greater relative peak intensity than the other comparison methods.

TI A new multimodal cortical source imaging algorithm for integrating
   simultaneously recorded EEG and MEG
SO INVERSE PROBLEMS IN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB In this study, we propose a new cortical source imaging algorithm for integrating simultaneously recorded electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), which takes into account the different sensitivity characteristics of the two modalities with respect to cortical source orientations. It is generally accepted that MEG can record neuronal electrical activities with higher spatial resolution than EEG because magnetic field is less affected by the inhomogeneous conductivity profile of the human head than electric field. Nevertheless, it is also well known that MEG cannot reliably detect neuronal sources with radial orientation, whereas EEG is relatively less dependent on the source orientations than MEG. However, this intrinsic difference has not previously been taken into account in the integrative cortical source imaging using simultaneously recorded EEG and MEG data. To consider the different directional sensitivities of the two modalities, we conceptually decomposed the sensor and source spaces into radial and tangential components and developed an explicit formulation described as a general type of weighted minimum norm estimation. Using extensive computer simulations, we demonstrated that our proposed algorithm substantially enhances localization accuracy over almost the entire cortical surface compared to that of the conventional integration algorithm and results in a significant improvement especially when either a radial or tangential source component is dominant.

TI An electrophysiological investigation of non-symbolic magnitude
   processing: Numerical distance effects in children with and without
   mathematical learning disabilities
SO CORTEX
AB Introduction: The aim of the present study was to probe electrophysiological effects of non-symbolic numerical processing in 20 children with mathematical learning disabilities (mean age = 99.2 months) compared to a group of 20 typically developing matched controls (mean age = 98.4 months).
   Methods: EEG data were obtained while children were tested with a standard non-symbolic numerical comparison paradigm that allowed us to investigate the effects of numerical distance manipulations for different set sizes, i.e., the classical subitizing, counting and estimation ranges. Effects of numerical distance manipulations on event-related potential (ERP) amplitudes as well as activation patterns of underlying current sources were analyzed.
   Results: In typically developing children, the amplitudes of a late parietal positive-going ERP component showed systematic numerical distance effects that did not depend on set size. For the group of children with mathematical learning disabilities, ERP distance effects were found only for stimuli within the subitizing range. Current source density analysis of distance-related group effects suggested that areas in right inferior parietal regions are involved in the generation of the parietal ERP amplitude differences.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that right inferior parietal regions are recruited differentially by controls compared to children with mathematical learning disabilities in response to non-symbolic numerical magnitude processing tasks, but only for stimuli with set sizes that exceed the subitizing range.

TI Brain-heart coupling at the P300 latency is linked to anterior cingulate
   cortex and insula-A cardio-electroencephalographic covariance tracing
   study
SO BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY
AB Prior work on the coupling of cortical and cardiac responses to feedback demonstrated that feedback-evoked single-trial EEG magnitudes 300 ms post-stimulus predict the degree of subsequent cardiac acceleration. The main goal of the current study was to explore the neural sources of this phenomenon using (a) independent component analysis in conjunction with dipole fitting and (b) low resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) in N = 14 participants who performed a gambling task with feedback presented after each trial. It was shown that independent components localized near anterior cingulate cortex produced robust within-subjects correlations with feedback-evoked heart-period, suggesting that anterior cingulate cortex activity 300 ms after feedback presentation predicts the strength of subsequent cardiac acceleration. Moreover, interindividual differences in evoked left insular cortex LORETA-estimated activity at around 300 ms moderated within-subjects EEG-heart period correlations. These results suggest that key regions of central autonomic control are involved in cortico-cardiac coupling evoked by feedback stimuli. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

TI Sparse current source estimation for MEG using loose orientation
   constraints
SO HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING
AB Spatially focal source estimates for magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) data can be obtained by imposing a minimum (1)-norm constraint on the distribution of the source currents. Anatomical information about the expected locations and orientations of the sources can be included in the source models. In particular, the sources can be assumed to be oriented perpendicular to the cortical surface. We introduce a minimum (1)-norm estimation source modeling approach with loose orientation constraints ((LOC)-L-1), which integrates the estimation of the orientation, location, and strength of the source currents into a cost function to jointly model the residual error and the (1)-norm of the source estimates. Evaluation with simulated MEG data indicated that the (LOC)-L-1 method can provide low spatial dispersion, high localization accuracy, and high source detection rates. Application to somatosensory and auditory MEG data resulted in physiologically reasonable source distributions. The proposed (LOC)-L-1 method appears useful for incorporating anatomical information about the source orientations into sparse source estimation of MEG data. Hum Brain Mapp 34:2190-2201, 2013.

TI Matching Pursuit and Source Deflation for Sparse EEG/MEG Dipole Moment
   Estimation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB In this paper, we propose novel matching pursuit (MP)-based algorithms for EEG/MEG dipole source localization and parameter estimation for multiple measurement vectors with constant sparsity. The algorithms combine the ideas of MP for sparse signal recovery and source deflation, as employed in estimation via alternating projections. The source-deflated matching pursuit (SDMP) approach mitigates the problem of residual interference inherent in sequential MP-based methods or recursively applied (RAP)-MUSIC. Furthermore, unlike prior methods based on alternating projection, SDMP allows one to efficiently estimate the dipole orientation in addition to its location. Simulations show that the proposed algorithms outperform existing techniques under various conditions, including those with highly correlated sources. Results using real EEG data from auditory experiments are also presented to illustrate the performance of these algorithms.

TI Task modulation of brain responses in visual word recognition as studied
   using EEG/MEG and fMRI
SO FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE
AB Do task demands change the way we extract information from a stimulus, or only how we use this information for decision making? In order to answer this question for visual word recognition, we used EEG/MEG as well as fMRI to determine the latency ranges and spatial areas in which brain activation towords is modulated by task demands. We presented letter strings in three tasks (lexical decision, semantic decision, silent reading), and measured combined EEG/MEG as well as fMRI responses in two separate experiments. EEG/MEG sensor statistics revealed the earliest reliable task effects at around 150 ms, which were localized, using minimum norm estimates (MNE), to left inferior temporal, right anterior temporal and left precentral gyri. Later task effects (250 and 480 ms) occurred in left middle and inferior temporal gyri. Our fMRI data showed task effects in left inferior frontal, posterior superior temporal and precentral cortices. Although there was some correspondence between fMRI and EEG/MEG localizations, discrepancies predominated. We suggest that fMRI may be less sensitive to the early short-lived processes revealed in our EEG/MEG data. Our results indicate that task-specific processes start to penetrate word recognition already at 150 ms, suggesting that early word processing is flexible and intertwined with decision making.

TI The Loudness Dependence of Auditory Evoked Potentials (LDAEP) as an
   Indicator of Serotonergic Dysfunction in Patients with Predominant
   Schizophrenic Negative Symptoms
SO PLOS ONE
AB Besides the influence of dopaminergic neurotransmission on negative symptoms in schizophrenia, there is evidence that alterations of serotonin (5-HT) system functioning also play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of these disabling symptoms. From post mortem and genetic studies on patients with negative symptoms a 5-HT dysfunction is documented. In addition atypical neuroleptics and some antidepressants improve negative symptoms via serotonergic action. So far no research has been done to directly clarify the association between the serotonergic functioning and the extent of negative symptoms. Therefore, we examined the status of brain 5-HT level in negative symptoms in schizophrenia by means of the loudness dependence of auditory evoked potentials (LDAEP). The LDAEP provides a well established and non-invasive in vivo marker of the central 5-HT activity. We investigated 13 patients with schizophrenia with predominant negative symptoms treated with atypical neuroleptics and 13 healthy age and gender matched controls with a 32-channel EEG. The LDAEP of the N1/P2 component was evaluated by dipole source analysis and single electrode estimation at Cz. Psychopathological parameters, nicotine use and medication were assessed to control for additional influencing factors. Schizophrenic patients showed significantly higher LDAEP in both hemispheres than controls. Furthermore, the LDAEP in the right hemisphere in patients was related to higher scores in scales assessing negative symptoms. A relationship with positive symptoms was not found. These data might suggest a diminished central serotonergic neurotransmission in patients with predominant negative symptoms.

TI Deficient multisensory integration in schizophrenia: An event-related
   potential study
SO SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH
AB Background: In many natural audiovisual events (e. g., the sight of a face articulating the syllable /ba/), the visual signal precedes the sound and thus allows observers to predict the onset and the content of the sound. In healthy adults, the N1 component of the event-related brain potential (ERP), reflecting neural activity associated with basic sound processing, is suppressed if a sound is accompanied by a video that reliably predicts sound onset. If the sound does not match the content of the video (e. g., hearing /ba/ while lipreading /fu/), the later occurring P2 component is affected. Here, we examined whether these visual information sources affect auditory processing in patients with schizophrenia.
   Methods: The electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded in 18 patients with schizophrenia and compared with that of 18 healthy volunteers. As stimuli we used video recordings of natural actions in which visual information preceded and predicted the onset of the sound that was either congruent or incongruent with the video.
   Results: For the healthy control group, visual information reduced the auditory-evoked N1 if compared to a sound-only condition, and stimulus-congruency affected the P2. This reduction in N1 was absent in patients with schizophrenia, and the congruency effect on the P2 was diminished. Distributed source estimations revealed deficits in the network subserving audiovisual integration in patients with schizophrenia.
   Conclusions: The results show a deficit in multisensory processing in patients with schizophrenia and suggest that multisensory integration dysfunction may be an important and, to date, under-researched aspect of schizophrenia. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Spontaneous pre-stimulus fluctuations in the activity of right
   fronto-parietal areas influence inhibitory control performance
   (Retracted article. See vol. 7, pg. 923, 2013)
SO FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE
AB Inhibitory control refers to the ability to suppress planned or ongoing cognitive or motor processes. Electrophysiological indices of inhibitory control failure have been found to manifest even before the presentation of the stimuli triggering the inhibition, suggesting that pre-stimulus brain-states modulate inhibition performance. However, previous electrophysiological investigations on the state-dependency of inhibitory control were based on averaged event-related potentials (ERPs), a method eliminating the variability in the ongoing brain activity not time-locked to the event of interest. These studies thus left unresolved whether spontaneous variations in the brain-state immediately preceding unpredictable inhibition-triggering stimuli also influence inhibitory control performance. To address this question, we applied single-trial EEG topographic analyses on the time interval immediately preceding NoGo stimuli in conditions where the responses to NoGo trials were correctly inhibited [correct rejection (CR)] vs. committed [false alarms (FAs)] during an auditory spatial Go/NoGo task. We found a specific configuration of the EEG voltage field manifesting more frequently before correctly inhibited responses to NoGo stimuli than before FAs. There was no evidence for an EEG topography occurring more frequently before FAs than before CR. The visualization of distributed electrical source estimations of the EEG topography preceding successful response inhibition suggested that it resulted from the activity of a right fronto-parietal brain network. Our results suggest that the fluctuations in the ongoing brain activity immediately preceding stimulus presentation contribute to the behavioral outcomes during an inhibitory control task. Our results further suggest that the state-dependency of sensory-cognitive processing might not only concern perceptual processes, but also high-order, top-down inhibitory control mechanisms.

TI Algorithms and Bounds for Dynamic Causal Modeling of Brain Connectivity
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING
AB Recent advances in neurophysiology have led to the development of complex dynamical models that describe the connections and causal interactions between different regions of the brain. These models are able to accurately mimic the event-related potentials observed by EEG/MEG measurement systems, and are considered to be key components for understanding brain functionality. In this paper, we focus on a class of nonlinear dynamic causal models (DCM) that are described by a set of connectivity parameters. In practice, the DCM parameters are inferred using data obtained by an EEG or MEG sensor array in response to a certain event or stimulus, and then used to analyze the strength and direction of the causal interactions between different brain regions. The usefulness of these parameters in this process will depend on how accurately they can be estimated, which in turn will depend on noise, the sampling rate, number of data samples collected, the accuracy of the source localization and reconstruction steps, etc. The goals of this paper are to present several algorithms for DCM parameter estimation, derive Cramer-Rao performance bounds for the estimates, and compare the accuracy of the algorithms against the theoretical performance limits under a variety of circumstances. The influence of noise and sampling rate will be explicitly investigated.

AB Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a promising technology, which could be used in a variety of biomedical applications. However, MEG electromagnetic measurement is usually degraded by noise. Noise suppression in MEG measurement is particularly challenging because it is difficult to remove the noise and preserve the information components in the MEG data. In this study, a novel noise suppression method, based on robust principal component analysis (RPCA) technique, is presented and applied to the estimation of bio-electromagnetic field in source space for the first time. The proposed method gives a constrained optimization of MEG electromagnetic domain transformations such that the matrix of transformed MEG measurement can be decomposed as the sum of a sparse matrix of noise and a low-rank matrix of denoised data. Applying the proposed method to a number of simulations showed significant improvement of the result accuracy.

TI Time-frequency mixed-norm estimates: Sparse M/EEG imaging with
   non-stationary source activations
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) allow functional brain imaging with high temporal resolution. While solving the inverse problem independently at every time point can give an image of the active brain at every millisecond, such a procedure does not capitalize on the temporal dynamics of the signal. Linear inverse methods (minimum-norm, dSPM, sLORETA, beamformers) typically assume that the signal is stationary: regularization parameter and data covariance are independent of time and the time varying signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Other recently proposed non-linear inverse solvers promoting focal activations estimate the sources in both space and time while also assuming stationary sources during a time interval. However such a hypothesis holds only for short time intervals. To overcome this limitation, we propose time-frequency mixed-norm estimates (TF-MxNE), which use time-frequency analysis to regularize the ill-posed inverse problem. This method makes use of structured sparse priors defined in the time-frequency domain, offering more accurate estimates by capturing the non-stationary and transient nature of brain signals. State-of-the-art convex optimization procedures based on proximal operators are employed, allowing the derivation of a fast estimation algorithm. The accuracy of the TF-MxNE is compared with recently proposed inverse solvers with help of simulations and by analyzing publicly available MEG datasets. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Influence of a Silastic ECoG Grid on EEG/ECoG Based Source Analysis
SO BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY
AB The simultaneous evaluation of the local electrocorticogram (ECoG) and the more broadly distributed electroencephalogram (EEG) from humans undergoing evaluation for epilepsy surgery has been shown to further the understanding of how pathologies give rise to spontaneous seizures. However, a well-known problem is that the disruption of the conducting properties of the brain coverings can render simultaneous scalp and intracranial recordings unrepresentative of the habitual EEG. The ECoG electrodes for measuring the potential on the surface of the cortex are commonly embedded into one or more sheets of a silastic material. These highly resistive silastic sheets influence the volume conduction and might therefore also influence the scalp EEG and ECoG measurements. We carried out a computer simulation study to examine how the scalp EEG and the ECoG, as well as the source reconstruction therefrom, employing equivalent current dipole estimation methods, are affected by the insulating ECoG grids. The finite element method with high quality tetrahedral meshes, generated using a constrained Delaunay tetrahedralization meshing approach, was used to model the volume conductor that incorporates the very thin ECoG sheets. It is shown that the insulating silastic substrate of the ECoG grids can have a large impact on the scalp potential and on source reconstruction from scalp EEG data measured in the presence of the grids. The reconstruction errors are characterized with regard to the location of the source in the brain and the mislocalization tendency. In addition, we found a non-negligible influence of the insulating grids on ECoG based source analysis. We conclude, that the thin insulating ECoG sheets should be taken into account, when performing source analysis of simultaneously measured ECoG and scalp EEG data.

TI Plastic modifications within inhibitory control networks induced by
   practicing a stop-signal task: An electrical neuroimaging study
SO CORTEX
AB Introduction: Inhibitory control refers to our ability to suppress ongoing motor, affective or cognitive processes and mostly depends on a fronto-basal brain network. Inhibitory control deficits participate in the emergence of several prominent psychiatric conditions, including attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder or addiction. The rehabilitation of these pathologies might therefore benefit from training-based behavioral interventions aiming at improving inhibitory control proficiency and normalizing the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms. The development of an efficient inhibitory control training regimen first requires determining the effects of practicing inhibition tasks.
   Methods: We addressed this question by contrasting behavioral performance and electrical neuroimaging analyses of event-related potentials (ERPs) recorded from humans at the beginning versus the end of 1 h of practice on a stop-signal task (SST) involving the withholding of responses when a stop signal was presented during a speeded auditory discrimination task.
   Results: Practicing a short SST improved behavioral performance. Electrophysiologically, ERPs differed topographically at 200 msec post-stimulus onset, indicative of the engagement of distinct brain network with learning. Source estimations localized this effect within the inferior frontal gyrus, the pre-supplementary motor area and the basal ganglia.
   Conclusion: Our collective results indicate that behavioral and brain responses during an inhibitory control task are subject to fast plastic changes and provide evidence that high-order fronto-basal executive networks can be modified by practicing a SST.

TI Shrinkage Approach for Spatiotemporal EEG Covariance Matrix Estimation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING
AB The characterization of the background activity in electroencephalography (EEG) is of interest in many problems, such as in the study of the brain rhythms and in the solution of the inverse problem for source localization. In most cases the background activity is modeled as a random process, and a basic characterization is done via the second order moments of the process, i.e., the spatiotemporal covariance. The general spatiotemporal covariance matrix of the background activity in EEG is extremely large. To reduce its dimensionality it is generally decomposed as a Kronecker product of a spatial and a temporal covariance matrices. They are generally estimated from the data using sample estimators, which have numerical and statistical problems when the number of trials is small. We present a shrinkage estimator for both EEG spatial and temporal covariance matrices of the background activity. We show that this estimator outperforms the commonly used ones when the quantity of available data is low. We find sufficient conditions for the consistency of the shrinkage estimator and present some results concerning its numerical stability. We compare several shrinkage approaches and show how to improve the estimator by incorporating known structure in the covariance matrix based on background activity models. Results using simulated and real EEG data support our approach.

TI Dynamic changes of ICA-derived EEG functional connectivity in the
   resting state
SO HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING
AB An emerging issue in neuroscience is how to identify baseline state(s) and accompanying networks termed resting state networks (RSNs). Although independent component analysis (ICA) in fMRI studies has elucidated synchronous spatiotemporal patterns during cognitive tasks, less is known about the changes in EEG functional connectivity between eyes closed (EC) and eyes open (EO) states, two traditionally used baseline indices. Here we investigated healthy subjects (n = 27) in EC and EO employing a four-step analytic approach to the EEG: (1) group ICA to extract independent components (ICs), (2) standardized low-resolution tomography analysis (sLORETA) for cortical source localization of IC network nodes, followed by (3) graph theory for functional connectivity estimation of epochwise IC band-power, and (4) circumscribing IC similarity measures via hierarchical cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling (MDS). Our proof-of-concept results on alpha-band power demonstrate five statistically clustered groups with frontal, central, parietal, occipitotemporal, and occipital sources. Importantly, during EO compared with EC, graph analyses revealed two salient functional networks with frontoparietal connectivity: a more medial network with nodes in the mPFC/precuneus which overlaps with the default-mode network (DMN), and a more lateralized network comprising the middle frontal gyrus and inferior parietal lobule, coinciding with the dorsal attention network (DAN). Furthermore, a separate MDS analysis of ICs supported the emergence of a pattern of increased proximity (shared information) between frontal and parietal clusters specifically for the EO state. We propose that the disclosed component groups and their source-derived EEG functional connectivity maps may be a valuable method for elucidating direct neuronal (electrophysiological) RSNs in healthy people and those suffering from brain disorders.

TI Localization of Synchronous Cortical Neural Sources
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB Neural synchronization is a key mechanism to a wide variety of brain functions, such as cognition, perception, or memory. High temporal resolution achieved by EEG recordings allows the study of the dynamical properties of synchronous patterns of activity at a very fine temporal scale but with very low spatial resolution. Spatial resolution can be improved by retrieving the neural sources of EEG signal, thus solving the so-called inverse problem. Although many methods have been proposed to solve the inverse problem and localize brain activity, few of them target the synchronous brain regions. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm aimed at localizing specifically synchronous brain regions and reconstructing the time course of their activity. Using multivariate wavelet ridge analysis, we extract signals capturing the synchronous events buried in the EEG and then solve the inverse problem on these signals. Using simulated data, we compare results of source reconstruction accuracy achieved by our method to a standard source reconstruction approach. We show that the proposed method performs better across a wide range of noise levels and source configurations. In addition, we applied our method on real dataset and identified successfully cortical areas involved in the functional network underlying visual face perception. We conclude that the proposed approach allows an accurate localization of synchronous brain regions and a robust estimation of their activity.

TI Improved method for retinotopy constrained source estimation of
   visual-evoked responses
SO HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING
AB Retinotopy constrained source estimation (RCSE) is a method for noninvasively measuring the time courses of activation in early visual areas using magnetoencephalography (MEG) or electroencephalography (EEG). Unlike conventional equivalent current dipole or distributed source models, the use of multiple, retinotopically mapped stimulus locations to simultaneously constrain the solutions allows for the estimation of independent waveforms for visual areas V1, V2, and V3, despite their close proximity to each other. We describe modifications that improve the reliability and efficiency of this method. First, we find that increasing the number and size of visual stimuli results in source estimates that are less susceptible to noise. Second, to create a more accurate forward solution, we have explicitly modeled the cortical point spread of individual visual stimuli. Dipoles are represented as extended patches on the cortical surface, which take into account the estimated receptive field size at each location in V1, V2, and V3 as well as the contributions from contralateral, ipsilateral, dorsal, and ventral portions of the visual areas. Third, we implemented a map fitting procedure to deform a template to match individual subject retinotopic maps derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This improves the efficiency of the overall method by allowing automated dipole selection, and it makes the results less sensitive to physiological noise in fMRI retinotopy data. Finally, the iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) method was used to reduce the contribution from stimulus locations with high residual error for robust estimation of visual evoked responses.

TI Greater robustness of second order statistics than higher order
   statistics algorithms to distortions of the mixing matrix in blind
   source separation of human EEG: Implications for single-subject and
   group analyses
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB A mandatory assumption in blind source separation (BSS) of the human electroencephalogram (EEG) is that the mixing matrix remains invariant, i.e., that the sources, electrodes and geometry of the head do not change during the experiment. Actually, this is not often the case. For instance, it is common that some electrodes slightly move during EEG recording. This issue is even more critical for group independent component analysis (gICA), a method of growing interest, in which only one mixing matrix is estimated for several subjects. Indeed, because of interindividual anatomo-functional variability, this method violates the mandatory principle of invariance. Here, using simulated (experiments 1 and 2) and real (experiment 3) EEG data, we test how eleven current BSS algorithms undergo distortions of the mixing matrix. We show that this usual kind of perturbation creates non-Gaussian features that are virtually added to all sources, impairing the estimation of real higher order statistics (HOS) features of the actual sources by HOS algorithms (e.g., Ext-INFOMAX, FASTICA). HOS-based methods are likely to identify more components (with similar properties) than actual neurological sources, a problem frequently encountered by BSS users. In practice, the quality of the recovered signal and the efficiency of subsequent source localization are substantially impaired. Performing dimensionality reduction before applying HOS-based BSS does not seem to be a safe strategy to circumvent the problem. Second order statistics (SOS)-based BSS methods belonging to the less popular SOBI family class are much less sensitive to this bias. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Dynamic causal modelling of lateral interactions in the visual cortex
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB This paper presents a dynamic causal model based upon neural field models of the Amari type. We consider the application of these models to non-invasive data, with a special focus on the mapping from source activity on the cortical surface to a single channel. We introduce a neural field model based upon the canonical microcircuit (CMC), in which neuronal populations are assigned to different cortical layers. We show that DCM can disambiguate between alternative (neural mass and field) models of cortical activity. However, unlike neural mass models, DCM with neural fields can address questions about neuronal microcircuitry and lateral interactions. This is because they are equipped with interlaminar connections and horizontal intra-laminar connections that are patchy in nature. These horizontal or lateral connections can be regarded as connecting macrocolumns with similar feature selectivity. Crucially, the spatial parameters governing horizontal connectivity determine the separation (width) of cortical macrocolumns. Thus we can estimate the width of macro columns, using non-invasive electromagnetic signals. We illustrate this estimation using dynamic causal models of steady-state or ongoing spectral activity measured using magnetoencephalography (MEG) in human visual cortex. Specifically, we revisit the hypothesis that the size of a macrocolumn is a key determinant of neuronal dynamics, particularly the peak gamma frequency. We are able to show a correlation, over subjects, between columnar size and peak gamma frequency - that fits comfortably with established correlations between peak gamma frequency and the size of visual cortex defined retinotopically. We also considered cortical excitability and assessed its relative influence on observed gamma activity. This example highlights the potential utility of dynamic causal modelling and neural fields in providing quantitative characterisations of spatially extended dynamics on the cortical surface - that are parameterised in terms of horizontal connections, implicit in the cortical micro-architecture and its synaptic parameters.

TI Multi-source Neural Activity Estimation and Sensor Scheduling:
   Algorithms and Hardware Implementation
SO JOURNAL OF SIGNAL PROCESSING SYSTEMS FOR SIGNAL IMAGE AND VIDEO
   TECHNOLOGY
AB Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) measurements are used to localize neural activity by solving the electromagnetic inverse problem. In this paper, we propose a new approach based on the particle filter implementation of the probability hypothesis density filter (PF-PHDF) to automatically estimate the unknown number of time-varying neural dipole sources and their parameters using EEG/MEG measurements. We also propose an efficient sensor scheduling algorithm to adaptively configure EEG/MEG sensors at each time step to reduce total power consumption. We demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed algorithms using simulated neural activity data. We map the algorithms onto a Xilinx Virtex-5 field-programmable gate array (FPGA) platform and show that it only takes 10 ms to process 100 data samples using 6,400 particles. Thus, the proposed system can support real-time processing of an EEG/MEG neural activity system with a sampling rate of up to 10 kHz.

TI Optimal linear spatial filters for event-related potentials based on a
   spatio-temporal model: Asymptotical performance analysis
SO SIGNAL PROCESSING
AB In this paper, the estimation of spatio-temporal patterns in the context of event-related potentials or evoked potentials studies in neuroscience is addressed. The proposed framework (denoted xDAWN) has the advantage to require only the knowledge of the time of stimuli onsets which are determined by the experimental setup. A theoretical analysis of the xDAWN framework shows that it provides asymptotically optimal spatial filters under weak assumptions. The loss in signal to interference-plus-noise ratio due to finite sample effect is calculated in a closed form at the first order of perturbation and is then validated by simulations. This last result shows that the proposed method provides interesting performance and outperforms classical methods, such as independent component analysis, in a wide range of situations. Moreover, the xDAWN algorithm has the property to be robust with respect to the model parameter values. Finally, validations on real electro-encephalographic data confirm the good behavior of the proposed xDAWN framework in the context of a P300 speller brain-computer interface. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

TI Comparing parametric and nonparametric methods for detecting phase
   synchronization in EEG
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS
AB Detecting significant periods of phase synchronization in EEG recordings is a non-trivial task that is made especially difficult when considering the effects of volume conduction and common sources. In addition, EEG signals are often confounded by non-neural signals, such as artifacts arising from muscle activity or external electrical devices. A variety of phase synchronization analysis methods have been developed with each offering a different approach for dealing with these confounds. We investigate the use of a parametric estimation of the time-frequency transform as a means of improving the detection capability for a range of phase analysis methods. We argue that such an approach offers numerous benefits over using standard nonparametric approaches. We then demonstrate the utility of our technique using both simulated and actual EEG data by showing that the derived phase synchronization estimates are more robust to noise and volume conduction effects.

TI DYNAMO: Concurrent dynamic multi-model source localization method for
   EEG and/or MEG
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS
AB This work presents a new dipolar method to estimate the neural sources from separate or combined EEG and MEG data. The novelty lies in the simultaneous estimation and integration of neural sources from different dynamic models with different parameters, leading to a dynamic multi-model solution for the EEG/MEG source localization problem. The first key aspect of this method is defining the source model as a dipolar dynamic system, which allows for the estimation of the probability distribution of the sources within the Bayesian filter estimation framework. A second important aspect is the consideration of several banks of filters that simultaneously estimate and integrate the neural sources of different models. A third relevant aspect is that the final probability estimate is a result of the probabilistic integration of the neural sources of numerous models. Such characteristics lead to a new approach that does not require a prior definition neither of the number of sources or of the underlying temporal dynamics, allowing for the specification of multiple initial prior estimates. The method was validated by three sensor modalities with simulated data designed to impose difficult estimation situations, and with real EEG data recorded in a feedback error-related potential paradigm. On the basis of these evaluations, the method was able to localize the sources with high accuracy. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Electrical neuroimaging during auditory motion aftereffects reveals that auditory motion processing is motion sensitive but not direction selective. J Neurophysiol 109: 321-331, 2013. First published October 17, 2012; doi:10.1152/jn.00625.2012.-Following prolonged exposure to adaptor sounds moving in a single direction, participants may perceive stationary-probe sounds as moving in the opposite direction [direction-selective auditory motion aftereffect (aMAE)] and be less sensitive to motion of any probe sounds that are actually moving (motion-sensitive aMAE). The neural mechanisms of aMAEs, and notably whether they are due to adaptation of direction-selective motion detectors, as found in vision, is presently unknown and would provide critical insight into auditory motion processing. We measured human behavioral responses and auditory evoked potentials to probe sounds following four types of moving-adaptor sounds: leftward and rightward unidirectional, bidirectional, and stationary. Behavioral data replicated both direction-selective and motion-sensitive aMAEs. Electrical neuroimaging analyses of auditory evoked potentials to stationary probes revealed no significant difference in either global field power (GFP) or scalp topography between leftward and rightward conditions, suggesting that aMAEs are not based on adaptation of direction-selective motion detectors. By contrast, the bidirectional and stationary conditions differed significantly in the stationary-probe GFP at 200 ms poststimulus onset without concomitant topographic modulation, indicative of a difference in the response strength between statistically indistinguishable intracranial generators. The magnitude of this GFP difference was positively correlated with the magnitude of the motion-sensitive aMAE, supporting the functional relevance of the neurophysiological measures. Electrical source estimations revealed that the GFP difference followed from a modulation of activity in predominantly right hemisphere frontal-temporal-parietal brain regions previously implicated in auditory motion processing. Our collective results suggest that auditory motion processing relies on motion-sensitive, but, in contrast to vision, non-directionselective mechanisms.

TI A critical assessment of connectivity measures for EEG data: A
   simulation study
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB Information flow between brain areas is difficult to estimate from EEG measurements due to the presence of noise as well as due to volume conduction. We here test the ability of popular measures of effective connectivity to detect an underlying neuronal interaction from simulated EEG data, as well as the ability of commonly used inverse source reconstruction techniques to improve the connectivity estimation. We find that volume conduction severely limits the neurophysiological interpretability of sensor-space connectivity analyses. Moreover, it may generally lead to conflicting results depending on the connectivity measure and statistical testing approach used. In particular, we note that the application of Granger-causal (GC) measures combined with standard significance testing leads to the detection of spurious connectivity regardless of whether the analysis is performed on sensor-space data or on sources estimated using three different established inverse methods. This empirical result follows from the definition of GC. The phase-slope index (PSI) does not suffer from this theoretical limitation and therefore performs well on our simulated data.
   We develop a theoretical framework to characterize artifacts of volume conduction, which may still be present even in reconstructed source time series as zero-lag correlations, and to distinguish their time-delayed brain interaction. Based on this theory we derive a procedure which suppresses the influence of volume conduction, but preserves effects related to time-lagged brain interaction in connectivity estimates. This is achieved by using time-reversed data as surrogates for statistical testing. We demonstrate that this robustification makes Granger-causal connectivity measures applicable to EEG data, achieving similar results as PSI. Integrating the insights of our study, we provide a guidance for measuring brain interaction from EEG data. Software for generating benchmark data is made available. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

TI MEG and EEG data analysis with MNE-Python
SO FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE
AB Magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography (M/EEG) measure the weak electromagnetic signals generated by neuronal activity in the brain. Using these signals to characterize and locate neural activation in the brain is a challenge that requires expertise in physics, signal processing, statistics, and numerical methods. As part of the MNE software suite, MNE-Python is an open-source software package that addresses this challenge by providing state-of-the-art algorithms implemented in Python that cover multiple methods of data preprocessing, source localization, statistical analysis, and estimation of functional connectivity between distributed brain regions. All algorithms and utility functions are implemented in a consistent manner with well-documented interfaces, enabling users to create M/EEG data analysis pipelines by writing Python scripts. Moreover, MNE-Python is tightly integrated with the core Python libraries for scientific comptutation (NumPy, SciPy) and visualization (matplotlib and Mayavi), as well as the greater neuroimaging ecosystem in Python via the Nibabel package. The code is provided under the new BSD license allowing code reuse, even in commercial products. Although MNE-Python has only been under heavy development for a couple of years, it has rapidly evolved with expanded analysis capabilities and pedagogical tutorials because multiple labs have collaborated during code development to help share best practices. MNE-Python also gives easy access to preprocessed datasets, helping users to get started quickly and facilitating reproducibility of methods by other researchers. Full documentation, including dozens of examples, is available at http://martinos.org/mne.

TI Generator localization by current source density (CSD): Implications of
   volume conduction and field closure at intracranial and scalp
   resolutions
SO CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB The topographic ambiguity and reference-dependency that has plagued EEG/ERP research throughout its history are largely attributable to volume conduction, which may be concisely described by a vector form of Ohm's Law. This biophysical relationship is common to popular algorithms that infer neuronal generators via inverse solutions. It may be further simplified as Poisson's source equation, which identifies underlying current generators from estimates of the second spatial derivative of the field potential (Laplacian transformation). Intracranial current source density (CSD) studies have dissected the "cortical dipole" into intracortical sources and sinks, corresponding to physiologically-meaningful patterns of neuronal activity at a sublaminar resolution, much of which is locally cancelled (i.e., closed field). By virtue of the macroscopic scale of the scalp-recorded EEG, a surface Laplacian reflects the radial projections of these underlying currents, representing a unique, unambiguous measure of neuronal activity at scalp. Although the surface Laplacian requires minimal assumptions compared to complex, model-sensitive inverses, the resulting waveform topographies faithfully summarize and simplify essential constraints that must be placed on putative generators of a scalp potential topography, even if they arise from deep or partially-closed fields. CSD methods thereby provide a global empirical and biophysical context for generator localization, spanning scales from intracortical to scalp recordings.

TI Cortical sources of resting state EEG rhythms are abnormal in dyslexic
   children
SO CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB Objective: Previous studies have been inconclusive whether dominant resting state alpha rhythms differ in amplitude in dyslexic subjects when compared to control subjects, being these rhythms considered as a reflection of effective cortical neural synchronization and cognition. Here we used a validated EEG source estimation to test the hypothesis that resting state alpha rhythms are abnormal in dyslexic subjects and are related to reading deficits.
   Methods: Eyes-closed resting state electroencephalographic (EEG) data were recorded in 26 dyslexics (12 males, mean age of 11 years +/- 0.5 standard error of mean, SEM) and 11 age-matched normal control subjects (8 males, mean age of 11 years +/- 0.7 SEM). EEG rhythms of interest, based on individual alpha frequency peak, were the following: about 2-4 Hz (delta), 4-6 Hz (theta), 6-8 Hz (alpha 1), 8-10 Hz (alpha 2), and 10-12 Hz (alpha 3). For the higher frequencies, we selected beta 1 (13-20 Hz), beta 2 (20-30 Hz), and gamma (30-40 Hz). Cortical EEG sources were estimated by low resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). LORETA solutions were normalized across all voxels and frequencies.
   Results: Compared to the control children, the dyslexics showed lower amplitude of parietal, occipital, and temporal alpha 2 and alpha 3 sources. In the dyslexics, some of these sources were correlated to reading time of pseudo-words (parietal alpha 2, r = -0.56, p = 0.02; parietal alpha 3, r = -0.58, p = 0.02; temporal alpha 3, r = -0.57, p = 0.02); the higher the alpha power, the shorter the reading time.
   Conclusions: Dyslexic children are characterized by limited abnormalities of resting state EEG rhythms as to topography (posterior regions) and frequency (alpha), which were related to phonological encoding (pseudo-words reading).
   Significance: Dyslexia may be associated to some functional impairment of cortical neuronal synchronization mechanisms involved in the resting state condition. (C) 2012 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Sparse imaging of cortical electrical current densities via wavelet
   transforms
SO PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
AB While the cerebral cortex in the human brain is of functional importance, functions defined on this structure are difficult to analyze spatially due to its highly convoluted irregular geometry. This study developed a novel L1-norm regularization method using a newly proposed multi-resolution face-based wavelet method to estimate cortical electrical activities in electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) inverse problems. The proposed wavelets were developed based on multi-resolution models built from irregular cortical surface meshes, which were realized in this study too. The multi-resolution wavelet analysis was used to seek sparse representation of cortical current densities in transformed domains, which was expected due to the compressibility of wavelets, and evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations. The EEG/MEG inverse problems were solved with the use of the novel L1-norm regularization method exploring the sparseness in the wavelet domain. The inverse solutions obtained from the new method using MEG data were evaluated by Monte Carlo simulations too. The present results indicated that cortical current densities could be efficiently compressed using the proposed face-based wavelet method, which exhibited better performance than the vertex-based wavelet method. In both simulations and auditory experimental data analysis, the proposed L1-norm regularization method showed better source detection accuracy and less estimation errors than other two classic methods, i.e. weighted minimum norm (wMNE) and cortical low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (cLORETA). This study suggests that the L1-norm regularization method with the use of face-based wavelets is a promising tool for studying functional activations of the human brain.

   Interstimulus Intervals during Formation of a Set to Emotionally
   Negative Facial Expression
SO ZHURNAL VYSSHEI NERVNOI DEYATELNOSTI IMENI I P PAVLOVA
AB The model of cognitive set to emotionally negative facial expression was used in the study (35 young healthy subjects) of EEG events in a 8-second interval between the target and triggering stimuli Coherence of brain potentials recorded from different cortical areas of the right and left brain hemispheres in the alpha and theta bands was analyzed in time segments within pre- and poststimulus intervals. A certain dynamics in the spatial synchronization in the alpha-band was revealed, which might reflect modulation of selective attention in time periods of the cognitive process providing its plasticity and set shift in response to a change in the situation. It is suggested that the source of attention modulation is the inner representation of the intervals between significant stimuli formed in the prefrontal cortex as a result of learning. Analysis of changes in the spatial synchronization in the theta band at individual stages of the set to angry face suggests that the corticohippocampal system is not directly involved in the time interval estimation but is linked to the emotional memory

TI Variational Bayesian localization of EEG sources with generalized
   Gaussian priors
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
AB Although in the last decades the use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging has grown in popularity as a tool for the structural analysis of the brain, including MRI, fMRI and recently DTI, the ElectroEncephaloGraphy (EEG) is, still today, an interesting technique for the understanding of brain organization and function. The main reason for this is that the EEG is a direct measure of brain bioelectrical activity, and such activity can be monitorized in the millisecond time window. For some situations and cognitive scenarios, such fine temporal resolution might suffice for some aspects of brain function; however, the EEG spatial resolution is very poor since it is based on a small number of scalp recordings, thus turning the source localization problem into an ill-posed one in which infinite possibilities exist for the localization of the neuronal generators. This is an old problem in computational neuroimaging; indeed, many methods have been proposed to overcome this localization. Here, by performing a Variational Bayesian Inference procedure with a generalized Gaussian prior, we come out with an algorithm that performs simultaneously the estimation of both sources and model parameters. The novelty for the inclusion of the generalized Gaussian prior allows to control the smoothness degree of the estimated sources. Finally, the suggested algorithm is validated on simulated data.

TI Asynchronous BCI Based on Motor Imagery With Automated Calibration and
   Neurofeedback Training
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING
AB A new multiclass brain-computer interface (BCI) based on the modulation of sensorimotor oscillations by imagining movements is described. By the application of advanced signal processing tools, statistics and machine learning, this BCI system offers: 1) asynchronous mode of operation, 2) automatic selection of user-dependent parameters based on an initial calibration, 3) incremental update of the classifier parameters from feedback data. The signal classification uses spatially filtered signals and is based on spectral power estimation computed in individualized frequency bands, which are automatically identified by a specially tailored AR-based model. Relevant features are chosen by a criterion based on Mutual Information. Final recognition of motor imagery is effectuated by a multinomial logistic regression classifier. This BCI system was evaluated in two studies. In the first study, five participants trained the ability to imagine movements of the right hand, left hand and feet in response to visual cues. The accuracy of the classifier was evaluated across four training sessions with feedback. The second study assessed the information transfer rate (ITR) of the BCI in an asynchronous application. The subjects' task was to navigate a cursor along a computer rendered 2-D maze. A peak information transfer rate of 8.0 bit/min was achieved. Five subjects performed with a mean ITR of 4.5 bit/min and an accuracy of 74.84%. These results demonstrate that the use of automated interfaces to reduce complexity for the intended operator (outside the laboratory) is indeed possible. The signal processing and classifier source code embedded in BCI2000 is available from https://www.brain-project.org/downloads.html.

TI Improved Surface Laplacian Estimates of Cortical Potential Using
   Realistic Models of Head Geometry
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB Surface Laplacian of scalp EEG can be used to estimate the potential distribution on the cortical surface as an alternative to invasive approaches. However, the accuracy of surface Laplacian estimation depends critically on the geometric shape of the head model. This paper presents a new method for computing the surface Laplacian of scalp potential directly on realistic scalp surfaces in the form of a triangular mesh reconstructed from MRI scans. Unlike previous methods, this algorithm does not resort to any surface fitting proxy and can improve the surface Laplacian estimation of cortical potential patterns by as much as 34% on realistically shaped head models. Simulations and experimental data are presented to demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method over the conventional spherical approximation and the utility of a more accurate surface Laplacian method for estimating cortical potentials from scalp electrodes.

TI A spatiotemporal dynamic distributed solution to the MEG inverse problem
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB MEG/EEG are non-invasive imaging techniques that record brain activity with high temporal resolution. However, estimation of brain source currents from surface recordings requires solving an ill-conditioned inverse problem. Converging lines of evidence in neuroscience, from neuronal network models to resting-state imaging and neurophysiology, suggest that cortical activation is a distributed spatiotemporal dynamic process, supported by both local and long-distance neuroanatomic connections. Because spatiotemporal dynamics of this kind are central to brain physiology, inverse solutions could be improved by incorporating models of these dynamics. In this article, we present a model for cortical activity based on nearest-neighbor autoregression that incorporates local spatiotemporal interactions between distributed sources in a manner consistent with neurophysiology and neuroanatomy. We develop a dynamic Maximum a Posteriori Expectation-Maximization (dMAP-EM) source localization algorithm for estimation of cortical sources and model parameters based on the Kalman Filter, the Fixed Interval Smoother, and the EM algorithms. We apply the dMAP-EM algorithm to simulated experiments as well as to human experimental data. Furthermore, we derive expressions to relate our dynamic estimation formulas to those of standard static models, and show how dynamic methods optimally assimilate past and future data. Our results establish the feasibility of spatiotemporal dynamic estimation in large-scale distributed source spaces with several thousand source locations and hundreds of sensors, with resulting inverse solutions that provide substantial performance improvements over static methods.

TI Harmony: EEG/MEG Linear Inverse Source Reconstruction in the Anatomical
   Basis of Spherical Harmonics
SO PLOS ONE
AB EEG/MEG source localization based on a "distributed solution'' is severely underdetermined, because the number of sources is much larger than the number of measurements. In particular, this makes the solution strongly affected by sensor noise. A new way to constrain the problem is presented. By using the anatomical basis of spherical harmonics (or spherical splines) instead of single dipoles the dimensionality of the inverse solution is greatly reduced without sacrificing the quality of the data fit. The smoothness of the resulting solution reduces the surface bias and scatter of the sources (incoherency) compared to the popular minimum-norm algorithms where single-dipole basis is used (MNE, depth-weighted MNE, dSPM, sLORETA, LORETA, IBF) and allows to efficiently reduce the effect of sensor noise. This approach, termed Harmony, performed well when applied to experimental data (two exemplars of early evoked potentials) and showed better localization precision and solution coherence than the other tested algorithms when applied to realistically simulated data.

TI A unified treatment of the reference estimation problem in depth EEG
   recordings
SO MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING
AB The starting point of this paper is the analysis of the reference problem in intra-cerebral electroencephalographic (iEEG) recordings. It is well accepted that both surface and depth EEG signals are always recorded with respect to some unknown time-varying signal called reference. This article discusses different methods for determining and reducing the influence of the reference signal for the iEEG signals. In particular, we derive optimal approaches for the estimation of the reference signal in iEEG recording setups and demonstrate their relation to the well-known minimum power/variance distortionless response approaches derived for general array and antenna signal processing applications. We show that the proposed approaches achieve optimal performance in terms of estimation error and that they outperform other reference identification methods proposed in the literature. The developed algorithms are illustrated on simulated examples and on real iEEG signals.

TI Quantifying Cognitive State From EEG Using Dependence Measures
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB The exquisite human ability to perceive facial features has been explained by the activity of neurons particularly responsive to faces, found in the fusiform gyrus and the anterior part of the superior temporal sulcus. This study hypothesizes and demonstrates that it is possible to automatically discriminate face processing from processing of a simple control stimulus based on processed EEGs in an online fashion with high temporal resolution using measures of statistical dependence applied on steady-state visual evoked potentials. Correlation, mutual information, and a novel measure of association, referred to as generalized measure of association (GMA), were applied on filtered current source density data. Dependences between channel locations were assessed for two separate conditions elicited by distinct pictures (a face and a Gabor grating) flickering at a rate of 17.5 Hz. Filter settings were chosen to minimize the distortion produced by bandpassing parameters on dependence estimation. Statistical analysis was performed for automated stimulus classification using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Results show active regions in the occipito-parietal part of the brain for both conditions with a greater dependence between occipital and inferotemporal sites for the face stimulus. GMA achieved a higher performance in discriminating the two conditions. Because no additional face-like stimuli were examined, this study established a basic difference between one particular face and one nonface stimulus. Future work may use additional stimuli and experimental manipulations to determine the specificity of the current connectivity results.

TI Sensitivity and specificity of seizure-onset zone estimation by ictal
   magnetoencephalography
SO EPILEPSIA
AB Purpose: Ictal videoelectroencephalography (EEG) is commonly used to establish ictal onset-zone location. Recently software development has enabled systematic studies of ictal magnetoencephalography (MEG). In this article, we evaluate the ability of ictal MEG signals to localize the seizure-onset zone. Methods: Twenty-six patients underwent ictal MEG and epilepsy surgery. Prediction of seizure-onset zone by ictal and interictal MEG was retrospectively compared with ictal-onset area found by intracranial EEG in 12 patients. The specificity and sensitivity of the prediction were calculated at hemisphere-lobe (HL) and at hemisphere-lobe-surface (HLS) levels. Key Findings: The sensitivity of ictal MEG source localization was 0.958 on HL and 0.706 on HLS levels, and its specificity was 0.900 on HL and 0.731 on HLS levels. The interictal MEG dipole cluster, defined as >10 dipoles on one lobar surface, had sensitivity of 0.400 and specificity of 0.769. Ictal MEG was equally sensitive and specific on dorsolateral and nondorsolateral neocortical surfaces up to a depth of 4 cm from the scalp. Significance: Sources of ictal-onset MEG signals and interictal dipole clusters are essentially equally specific in estimation of the ictal-onset zone on lobar surface resolution, but ictal MEG is more sensitive. On the lobe resolution, ictal MEG estimates ictal-onset zone with high sensitivity and specificity.

TI Electrode and brain modeling in stereo-EEG
SO CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB Objective: To quantify the perturbation due to the presence of a measuring depth electrode on the intracranial electric potential distribution, and to study the effect of the heterogeneity and anisotropy of the brain tissues' electric conductivity.
   Methods: The governing differential equations are solved with the Boundary Elements Method to compute the perturbation on the electric potential distribution caused by the presence of the measuring electrode, and with the Finite Elements Method to simulate measurements in an heterogeneous anisotropic brain model.
   Results: The perturbation on the measured electric potential is negligible if the source of electric activity is located more than approximately 1 mm away from the electrode. The error induced by this perturbation in the estimation of the source position is below 1 mm in all tested situations. The results hold for different sizes of the electrode's contacts. The effect of the brain's heterogeneity and anisotropy is more important. In a particular example simulated dipolar sources in the gray matter show localization differences of up to 5 mm between homogeneous isotropic and heterogeneous anisotropic brain models.
   Conclusions: It is not necessary to include detailed electrode models in order to solve the stereo-EEG (sEEG) forward and inverse problems. The heterogeneity and anisotropy of the brain electric conductivity should be modeled if possible. The effect of using an homogeneous isotropic brain model approximation should be studied in a case by case basis, since it depends on the electrode positions, the subject's electric conductivity map, and the source configuration.
   Significance: This simulation study is helpful for interpreting the sEEG measurements, and for choosing appropriate electrode and brain models; a necessary first step in any attempt to solve the sEEG inverse problem.

TI Neural plasticity associated with recently versus often heard objects
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB In natural settings the same sound source is often heard repeatedly, with variations in spectro-temporal and spatial characteristics. We investigated how such repetitions influence sound representations and in particular how auditory cortices keep track of recently vs. often heard objects. A set of 40 environmental sounds was presented twice, i.e. as prime and as repeat, while subjects categorized the corresponding sound sources as living vs. non-living. Electrical neuroimaging analyses were applied to auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) comparing primes vs. repeats (effect of presentation) and the four experimental sections. Dynamic analysis of distributed source estimations revealed i) a significant main effect of presentation within the left temporal convexity at 164-215 ms post-stimulus onset; and ii) a significant main effect of section in the right temporoparietal junction at 166-213 ms. A 3-way repeated measures ANOVA (hemisphere x presentation x section) applied to neural activity of the above clusters during the common time window confirmed the specificity of the left hemisphere for the effect of presentation, but not that of the right hemisphere for the effect of section. In conclusion, spatio-temporal dynamics of neural activity encode the temporal history of exposure to sound objects. Rapidly occurring plastic changes within the semantic representations of the left hemisphere keep track of objects heard a few seconds before, independent of the more general sound exposure history. Progressively occurring and more long-lasting plastic changes occurring predominantly within right hemispheric networks, which are known to code for perceptual, semantic and spatial aspects of sound objects, keep track of multiple exposures.

TI Cortical dynamics of human scalp EEG origins in a visually guided motor
   execution
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB The EEG mu rhythm is often used as an index of activation in the sensorimotor cortex. However, the blur caused by volume conduction makes it difficult to identify the exact origin of the EEG rhythm in the brain using only the human scalp EEG. In this study, simultaneous fMRI and EEG measurements were performed during a visually guided motor execution task in order to investigate whether the mu rhythm in the scalp EEG is an indication of the activity in the sensorimotor cortex. In addition, a new method was proposed for reconstruction of the cortical EEG activity through the fusion of fMRI and EEG data. A suppression of mu rhythm appeared around the lateral central electrode sites, just above the sensorimotor cortex, in association with the activity in that region. During a visually guided motor execution task, the alpha rhythms at the occipital electrode sites and the alpha rhythm at the central electrode sites also showed a correlation with the fMRI signal in the occipital and the supplementary motor cortices, respectively. This method allows the investigation of the scalp EEG origin with the spatial precision of fMRI, while retaining dynamic properties of the cortex with the temporal precision of EEG.

TI Anisotropic partial volume CSF modeling for EEG source localization
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB Electromagnetic source localization (ESL) provides non-invasive evaluation of brain electrical activity for neurology research and clinical evaluation of neurological disorders such as epilepsy. Accurate ESL results are dependent upon the use of patient specific models of bioelectric conductivity. While the effects of anisotropic conductivities in the skull and white matter have been previously studied, little attention has been paid to the accurate modeling of the highly conductive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) region.
   This study examines the effect that partial volume errors in CSF segmentations have upon the ESL bioelectric model. These errors arise when segmenting sulcal channels whose widths are similar to the resolution of the magnetic resonance (MR) images used for segmentation, as some voxels containing both CSF and gray matter cannot be definitively assigned a single label. These problems, particularly prevalent in pediatric populations, make voxelwise segmentation of CSF compartments a difficult problem. Given the high conductivity of CSF, errors in modeling this region may result in large errors in the bioelectric model.
   We introduce here a new approach for using estimates of partial volume fractions in the construction of patient specific bioelectric models. In regions where partial volume errors are expected, we use a layered gray matter-CSF model to construct equivalent anisotropic conductivity tensors. This allows us to account for the inhomogeneity of the tissue within each voxel. Using this approach, we are able to reduce the error in the resulting bioelectric models, as evaluated against a known high resolution model. Additionally, this model permits us to evaluate the effects of sulci modeling errors and quantify the mean error as a function of the change in sulci width.
   Our results suggest that both under and over-estimation of the CSF region leads to significant errors in the bioelectric model. While a model with fixed partial volume fraction is able to reduce this error, we see the largest improvement when using voxel specific partial volume estimates. Our cross-model analyses suggest that an approximately linear relationship exists between sulci error and the error in the resulting bioelectric model. Given the difficulty of accurately segmenting narrow sulcal channels, this suggests that our approach may be capable of improving the accuracy of patient specific bioelectric models by several percent, while introducing only minimal additional computational requirements.

TI Hierarchical Bayesian inference for the EEG inverse problem using
   realistic FE head models: Depth localization and source separation for
   focal primary currents
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB The estimation of the activity-related ion currents by measuring the induced electromagnetic fields at the head surface is a challenging and severely ill-posed inverse problem. This is especially true in the recovery of brain networks involving deep-lying sources by means of EEG/MEG recordings which is still a challenging task for any inverse method. Recently, hierarchical Bayesian modeling (HBM) emerged as a unifying framework for current density reconstruction (CDR) approaches comprising most established methods as well as offering promising new methods. Our work examines the performance of fully-Bayesian inference methods for HBM for source configurations consisting of few, focal sources when used with realistic, high-resolution finite element (FE) head models. The main foci of interest are the correct depth localization, a well-known source of systematic error of many CDR methods, and the separation of single sources in multiple-source scenarios. Both aspects are very important in the analysis of neurophysiological data and in clinical applications. For these tasks, HBM provides a promising framework and is able to improve upon established CDR methods such as minimum norm estimation (MNE) or sLORETA in many aspects. For challenging multiple-source scenarios where the established methods show crucial errors, promising results are attained. Additionally, we introduce Wasserstein distances as performance measures for the validation of inverse methods in complex source scenarios. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI SigMate: A MATLAB-based automated tool for extracellular neuronal signal
   processing and analysis
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS
AB Rapid advances in neuronal probe technology for multisite recording of brain activity have posed a significant challenge to neuroscientists for processing and analyzing the recorded signals. To be able to infer meaningful conclusions quickly and accurately from large datasets, automated and sophisticated signal processing and analysis tools are required. This paper presents a MATLAB-based novel tool, "SigMate", incorporating standard methods to analyze spikes and EEG signals, and in-house solutions for local field potentials (LFPs) analysis. Available modules at present are - 1. In-house developed algorithms for: data display (2D and 3D), file operations (file splitting, file concatenation, and file column rearranging), baseline correction, slow stimulus artifact removal, noise characterization and signal quality assessment, current source density (CSD) analysis, latency estimation from LFPs and CSDs, determination of cortical layer activation order using LFPs and CSDs, and single LFP clustering; 2. Existing modules: spike detection, sorting and spike train analysis, and EEG signal analysis. SigMate has the flexibility of analyzing multichannel signals as well as signals from multiple recording sources. The in-house developed tools for LFP analysis have been extensively tested with signals recorded using standard extracellular recording electrode, and planar and implantable multi transistor array (MTA) based neural probes. SigMate will be disseminated shortly to the neuroscience community under the open-source GNU-General Public License. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Projection Versus Prewhitening for EEG Interference Suppression
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB Suppression of strong, spatially correlated background interference is a challenge associated with electroencephalography (EEG) source localization problems. The most common way of dealing with such interference is through the use of a prewhitening transformation based on an estimate of the covariance of the interference plus noise. This approach is based on strong assumptions regarding temporal stationarity of the data, which do not commonly hold in EEG applications. In addition, prewhitening cannot typically be implemented directly due to ill conditioning of the covariance matrix, and ad hoc regularization is often necessary. Using both simulation examples and experiments involving real EEG data with auditory evoked responses, we demonstrate that a straightforward interference projection method is significantly more robust than prewhitening for EEG source localization.

TI Efficient Dipole Parameter Estimation in EEG Systems With Near-ML
   Performance
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB Source signals that have strong temporal correlation can pose a challenge for high-resolution EEG source localization algorithms. In this paper, we present two methods that are able to accurately locate highly correlated sources in situations where other high-resolution methods such as multiple signal classification and linearly constrained minimum variance beamforming fail. These methods are based on approximations to the optimal maximum likelihood (ML) approach, but offer significant computational advantages over ML when estimates of the equivalent EEG dipole orientation and moment are required in addition to the source location. The first method uses a two-stage approach in which localization is performed assuming an unstructured dipole moment model, and then the dipole orientation is obtained by using these estimates in a second step. The second method is based on the use of the noise subspace fitting concept, and has been shown to provide performance that is asymptotically equivalent to the direct ML method. Both techniques lead to a considerably simpler optimization than ML since the estimation of the source locations and dipole moments is decoupled. Examples using data from simulations and auditory experiments are presented to illustrate the performance of the algorithms.

TI The timing of exploratory decision-making revealed by single-trial
   topographic EEG analyses
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB Decision-making in an uncertain environment is driven by two major needs: exploring the environment to gather information or exploiting acquired knowledge to maximize reward. The neural processes underlying exploratory decision-making have been mainly studied by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging, overlooking any information about the time when decisions are made. Here, we carried out an electroencephalography (EEG) experiment, in order to detect the time when the brain generators responsible for these decisions have been sufficiently activated to lead to the next decision. Our analyses, based on a classification scheme, extract time-unlocked voltage topographies during reward presentation and use them to predict the type of decisions made on the subsequent trial. Classification accuracy, measured as the area under the Receiver Operator's Characteristic curve was on average 0.65 across 7 subjects. Classification accuracy was above chance levels already after 516 ms on average, across subjects. We :;peculate that decisions were already made before this critical period, as confirmed by a positive correlation with reaction times across subjects. On an individual subject basis, distributed source estimations were performed on the extracted topographies to statistically evaluate the neural correlates of decision-making. For trials leading to exploration, there was significantly higher activity in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the right supramarginal gyrus; areas responsible for modulating behavior under risk and deduction. No area was more active during exploitation. We show for the first time the temporal evolution of differential patterns of brain activation in an exploratory decision-making task on a single-trial basis. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

TI sLORETA allows reliable distributed source reconstruction based on
   subdural strip and grid recordings
SO HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING
AB Source localization based on invasive recordings by subdural strip and grid electrodes is a topic of increasing interest. This simulation study addresses the question, which factors are relevant for reliable source reconstruction based on sLORETA. MRI and electrode positions of a patient undergoing invasive presurgical epilepsy diagnostics were the basis of sLORETA simulations. A boundary element head model derived from the MRI was used for the simulation of electrical potentials and source reconstruction. Focal dipolar sources distributed on a regular three-dimensional lattice and spatiotemporal distributed patches served as input for simulation. In addition to the distance between original and reconstructed source maxima, the activation volume of the reconstruction and the correlation of time courses between the original and reconstructed sources were investigated. Simulations were supplemented by the localization of the patient's spike activity. For noise-free simulated data, sLORETA achieved results with zero localization error. Added noise diminished the percentage of reliable source localizations with a localization error =15 mm to 67.8%. Only for source positions close to the electrode contacts the activation volume correctly represented focal generators. Time-courses of original and reconstructed sources were significantly correlated. The case study results showed accurate localization. sLORETA is a distributed source model, which can be applied for reliable grid and strip based source localization. For distant source positions, overestimation of the extent of the generator has to be taken into account. sLORETA-based source reconstruction has the potential to improve the localization of distributed generators in presurgical epilepsy diagnostics and cognitive neuroscience.

TI The time-course of single-word reading: Evidence from fast behavioral
   and brain responses
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB We usually feel that we understand a familiar word "immediately". However, even basic aspects of the time-line of word recognition are still controversial. Different domains of research have still not converged on a coherent account. An integration of multiple sources of information would lead to more strongly constrained theoretical models, and help finding optimal measures when monitoring specific aspects of word recognition impairments in patient groups. In our multimodal approach - combining fast behavioral measures, ERPs and EEG/MEG source estimation - we provide converging evidence for the latencies of earliest lexical and semantic information retrieval in visual word recognition. Participants performed lexical and semantic decisions (LD, SD) in a Go/NoGo paradigm. We introduced eye-blink latencies as a dependent variable, in order to measure behavioral responses that are faster and less variable than traditional button presses. We found that the earliest behavioral responses distinguishing stimulus categories can occur around 310 ms. Ex-Gaussian analysis of behavioral responses did not reveal reliable differences between LD and SD. The earliest ERP differences between Go and NoGo conditions occurred around 160 ms for both LD and SD. Distributed source analysis of combined EEG/MEG data estimated neuronal generators for the lexicality effect around 200 ms in the left anterior middle temporal lobe. Thus, behavior and brain responses provide coherent evidence that the brain starts retrieving lexical and semantic information near-simultaneously within 200 ms of word onset. Our results support models of word recognition that assume a continuous accumulation of task-related information from the stimulus, which might be described by Bayesian principles.

TI An extended Kalman filtering approach for the estimation of human head
   tissue conductivities by using EEG data: a simulation study
SO PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT
AB In this study, we propose an extended Kalman filter approach for the estimation of the human head tissue conductivities in vivo by using electroencephalogram (EEG) data. Since the relationship between the surface potentials and conductivity distribution is nonlinear, the proposed algorithm first linearizes the system and applies extended Kalman filtering. By using a three-compartment realistic head model obtained from the magnetic resonance images of a real subject, a known dipole assumption and 32 electrode positions, the performance of the proposed method is tested in simulation studies and it is shown that the proposed algorithm estimates the tissue conductivities with less than 1% error in noiseless measurements and less than 5% error when the signal-to-noise ratio is 40 dB or higher. We conclude that the proposed extended Kalman filter approach successfully estimates the tissue conductivities in vivo.

AB This article describes the mechanics and rationale of four different approaches to the statistical testing of electrophysiological data: (1) the Neyman-Pearson approach, (2) the permutation-based approach, (3), the bootstrap-based approach, and (4) the Bayesian approach. These approaches are evaluated from the perspective of electrophysiological studies, which involve multivariate (i.e., spatiotemporal) observations in which source-level signals are picked up to a certain extent by all sensors. Besides formal statistical techniques, there are also techniques that do not involve probability calculations but are very useful in dealing with multivariate data (i.e., verification of data-based predictions, cross-validation, and localizers). Moreover, data-based decision making can also be informed by mechanistic evidence that is provided by the structure in the data.

TI Estimation of the spatiotemporal structure of event-related
   desynchronization and synchronization in magnetoencephalography
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS
AB We present a comprehensive methodology for identifying cerebral areas involved in event-related changes of electromagnetic activity of the human brain, and also for tracing the temporal evolution of this activity. Information from pre- and peristimulus time intervals - in terms of event-related synchronization (ERS) and desynchronization (ERD) of the magnetoencephalographic (MEG) signal - was directly incorporated in the relevant test statistics. For the individual steps of the analysis, we used particular estimations of the time-frequency distribution of the energy along with particular error control methods, that is, short-time Fourier transform and false-discovery rate at the sensor level and multitapers and familywise error rate at the source level. This procedure was applied to two types of group-level tests, a within-condition test and a between-conditions test. The performance of the proposed methodology is assessed by (1) analyzing the event-related brain activity from two experimental conditions of an auditory MEG experiment passive listening to a sequence of frequency-modulated sweeps and their active categorization with respect to the direction of frequency modulation, and (2) comparing the findings with those obtained with a widely used cluster-based analysis.

TI The spatiotemporal characteristics of elementary audiovisual speech and
   music processing in musically untrained subjects
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY
AB Previously, the EEG technique has been used to investigate the spatiotemporal properties of audiovisual (AV) processing by taking advantage of the violation of the "additive model", which is considered to be a very conservative approach. In the present work, we used a less conservative and novel approach than the criterion of superadditivity for estimating AV interactions. Hence, we estimated AV interaction patterns by comparing the responses to AV stimuli with the averaged responses to the unimodal visual and auditory stimuli in musically untrained subjects and by presenting syllables and piano tones coupled with flashlights. Our results suggest that the two AV objects elicited consistent interaction patterns within the time course of unisensory processing in the time range between 80 and 250 ms post stimulus onset. The scalp topographies, as well as the source estimation approach we adopted, indicate that the first interaction pattern at around 100 ms was partially driven by auditory-related cortical regions. Additionally, we found evidence for a second interaction pattern at around 200 ms that was mainly associated with the responsiveness of extra-sensory brain regions. During this later processing stage, only the music condition was associated with putative responses that originated from auditory-related cortical fields. This study provides a novel approach to investigate the basic principles underlying elementary AV speech and music processing in subjects without formal musical education. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

TI Brains "in concert": Frontal oscillatory alpha rhythms and empathy in
   professional musicians
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB Playing music in ensemble represents a unique human condition/performance where musicians should rely on empathic relationships. Recent theories attribute to frontal Brodmann areas (BAs) 44/45 and 10/11 a neural basis for "emotional" and "cognitive" empathy. We hypothesized that activity of these structures reflects empathy trait in professional musicians playing in ensemble. Simultaneous electroencephalographic (EEG) alpha rhythms (8-12 Hz) were recorded in three saxophone quartets during music performance in ensemble (EXECUTION), video observation of their own performance (OBSERVATION), a control task (CONTROL), and resting state (RESTING). EEG source estimation was performed. Results showed that the higher the empathy quotient test score, the higher the alpha desynchronization in right BA 44/45 during the OBSERVATION referenced to RESTING condition. Empathy trait score and alpha desynchronization were not correlated in other control areas or in EXECUTION/CONTROL conditions. These results suggest that alpha rhythms in BA 44/45 reflect "emotional" empathy in musicians observing own performance. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Performance evaluation of the Champagne source reconstruction algorithm

SO NEUROIMAGE
AB In this paper, we present an extensive performance evaluation of a novel source localization algorithm, Champagne. It is derived in an empirical Bayesian framework that yields sparse solutions to the inverse problem. It is robust to correlated sources and learns the statistics of non-stimulus-evoked activity to suppress the effect of noise and interfering brain activity. We tested Champagne on both simulated and real M/EEG data. The source locations used for the simulated data were chosen to test the performance on challenging source configurations. In simulations, we found that Champagne outperforms the benchmark algorithms in terms of both the accuracy of the source localizations and the correct estimation of source time courses. We also demonstrate that Champagne is more robust to correlated brain activity present in real MEG data and is able to resolve many distinct and functionally relevant brain areas with real MEG and EEG data.

TI Towards source volume estimation of interictal spikes in focal epilepsy
   using magnetoencephalography
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB Interictal spikes are a hallmark of cortical epileptogenicity: their spatial distribution in the cortex defines the so-called 'irritative' zone or spiking volume (SV). Delineating the SV precisely is a challenge during the presurgical evaluation of patients with epilepsy. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings enable determination of the brain sources of epileptic spikes using source localization procedures. Most previous clinical MEG studies have relied on dipole modeling of epileptic spikes, which does not permit a volumetric estimation of the spiking cortex.
   In the present study, we propose a new source modeling procedure, Volumetric Imaging of Epileptic Spikes (VIES). In VIES, the SV is identified as the 3D region where sources of the high frequency activities (>20 Hz) associated with epileptic spikes are distributed. We localized these sources using a beamforming approach (DICS, Dynamic Imaging of Coherent Neural Sources). To determine the optimal parameters and accuracy of the method, we compared the SV obtained by VIES with the SV defined by the invasive gold standard, intracranial stereotactic EEG recordings (SEEG), in 21 patients with focal epilepsy. Using rigorous validation criteria based on the exact anatomical location of SEEG contacts, we found that the overall sensitivity of VIES for detecting spiking SEEG contacts was 76% and its specificity for correctly identifying non-spiking SEEG contacts was 67%, indicating a good agreement between VIES and SEEG. Moreover, we found that classical dipole clustering was not informative in 9/21 patients, while VIES enable to delineate the SV in all patients. For the 12 patients having a SV delineated both with VIES and dipole clustering, VIES method had higher sensitivity and lower specificity. This proof-of-concept study shows that VIES is a promising approach to non-invasive estimation of the SV in focal epilepsy. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Cortical current source estimation from electroencephalography in
   combination with near-infrared spectroscopy as a hierarchical prior
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB Previous simulation and experimental studies have demonstrated that the application of Variational Bayesian Multimodal EncephaloGraphy (VBMEG) to magnetoencephalography (MEG) data can be used to estimate cortical currents with high spatio-temporal resolution, by incorporating functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity as a hierarchical prior. However, the use of combined MEG and fMRI is restricted by the high costs involved, a lack of portability and high sensitivity to body-motion artifacts. One possible solution for overcoming these limitations is to use a combination of electroencephalography (EEG) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). This study therefore aimed to extend the possible applications of VBMEG to include EEG data with NIRS activity as a hierarchical prior. Using computer simulations and real experimental data, we evaluated the performance of VBMEG applied to EEG data under different conditions, including different numbers of EEG sensors and different prior information. The results suggest that VBMEG with NIRS prior performs well, even with as few as 19 EEG sensors. These findings indicate the potential value of clinically applying VBMEG using a combination of EEG and NIRS. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Comparison of dense array EEG with simultaneous intracranial EEG for
   Interictal spike detection and localization
SO EPILEPSY RESEARCH
AB Purpose: To evaluate the clinical utility of dense array electroencephalography (dEEG) for the detection yield and localization of interictal spikes in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy.
   Methods: We simultaneously recorded 256-channel dEEG and intracranial electroencephalography (icEEG) implanted over the lateral and mesial temporal lobe in patients with intractable epilepsy. We calculated the dEEG spike detection rate for mesial temporal spikes which were confirmed by icEEG and applied source estimation to dEEG to compare noninvasive localization to the invasive recordings.
   Results: 339 of 760 interictal spikes (45%) were detected by dEEG examining the 256-channel head surface array. The average icEEG amplitude of dEEG detectable spikes was 1083 mu V, and that of dEEG undetectable spikes was 780 mu V (P < 0.05). All spikes detected in dEEG were localized to the temporal lobe. 295 of 339 spikes (87%) were well localized in mesial temporal lobe, close to the position confirmed by subdural electrodes.
   Significance: 256-channel dEEG may provide more precise information for the localization of interictal epileptiform discharges than conventional EEG or MEG in patients with deep spike foci. 256-channel dEEG may be clinically useful in the presurgical work-up for epilepsy, providing accurate noninvasive guidance for the placement of intracranial electrodes.

TI The role of energetic value in dynamic brain response adaptation during
   repeated food image viewing
SO APPETITE
AB The repeated presentation of simple objects as well as biologically salient objects can cause the adaptation of behavioral and neural responses during the visual categorization of these objects. Mechanisms of response adaptation during repeated food viewing are of particular interest for better understanding food intake beyond energetic needs. Here, we measured visual evoked potentials (VEPs) and conducted neural source estimations to initial and repeated presentations of high-energy and low-energy foods as well as non-food images. The results of our study show that the behavioral and neural responses to food and food-related objects are not uniformly affected by repetition. While the repetition of images displaying low-energy foods and non-food modulated VEPs as well as their underlying neural sources and increased behavioral categorization accuracy, the responses to high-energy images remained largely invariant between initial and repeated encounters. Brain mechanisms when viewing images of high-energy foods thus appear less susceptible to repetition effects than responses to low-energy and non-food images. This finding is likely related to the superior reward value of high-energy foods and might be one reason why in particular high-energetic foods are indulged although potentially leading to detrimental health consequences.

TI Setting Adaptive Spike Detection Threshold for Smoothed TEO Based on
   Robust Statistics Theory
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB We propose a novel approach aimed at adaptively setting the threshold of the smoothed Teager energy operator (STEO) detector to be used in extracellular recording of neural signals. In this proposed approach, to set the adaptive threshold of the STEO detector, we derive the relationship between the low-order statistics of its input signal and the ones of its output signal. This relationship is determined with only the background noise component assumed to be present at the input. Robust statistics theory techniques were used to achieve an unbiased estimation of these low-order statistics of the background noise component directly from the neural input signal. In this paper, the emphasis is made on extracellular neural recordings. However, the proposed method can be used in the analysis of different biomedical signals where spikes are important for diagnostic (e.g., ECG, EEG, etc.). We validated the efficacy of the proposed method using synthetic neural signals constructed from real neural recordings signals. Four different sets of extracellular recordings from four distinct neural sources have been exploited to that purpose. The first dataset is recorded from an adult male monkey using the Utath 10 x 10 microelectrode array implemented in the prefrontal cortex, the second one was obtained from the visual cortex of a rat using a stainless-steel-tipped microelectrode, the third dataset came from recording in a human medial lobe using intracranial electrode, and finally, the fourth one was extracted from recordings in a macaque parietal cortex using a single tetrode. Simulation results show that our approach is effective and robust, and outperforms state-of-the-art adaptive detection methods in its category (i.e., efficient and simple, and do not require a priori knowledge about neural spike waveforms shapes).

A novel weighting matrix building method obtained from the sensitivity similarity degree of the sensor array between the sources is presented, so as to enhance the property representation for the correlated deep sources.

TI Comparison and Improvement of Inverse Techniques for MEG Source
   Connectivity Network Reconstruction
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MAGNETICS
AB Recent studies on bio-electromagnetic inverse problems have shown that a satisfactory understanding of source mechanisms requires to perform source connectivity analyses. This paper focuses on the comparison of inverse techniques for reconstructing the source connectivity network. The results confirm that the noise effect for linear estimation technique is direct, while, for spatial filtering technique the effect is indirect. Linear estimation is advantageous for the connectivity reconstruction of high quality magnetoencephalography (MEG) data, while, the benefit for the case of spatial filter is low SNR environments. This paper also proposes a modified spatial filtering method to improve the source connectivity reconstruction by using the correlation gram matrix. The results show that the proposed method can increase the reconstruction accuracy, decrease the error fluctuation and enhance the representation for profiles of the original source connectivity network.

TI Regional electric field induced by electroconvulsive therapy in a
   realistic finite element head model: Influence of white matter
   anisotropic conductivity
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB We present the first computational study investigating the electric field (E-field) strength generated by various electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) electrode configurations in specific brain regions of interest (ROIs) that have putative roles in the therapeutic action and/or adverse side effects of ECT. This study also characterizes the impact of the white matter (WM) conductivity anisotropy on the E-field distribution. A finite element head model incorporating tissue heterogeneity and WM anisotropic conductivity was constructed based on structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor MRI data. We computed the spatial E-field distributions generated by three standard ECT electrode placements including bilateral (BL), bifrontal (BF), and right unilateral (RUL) and an investigational electrode configuration for focal electrically administered seizure therapy (FEAST). The key results are that (1) the median E-field strength over the whole brain is 3.9, 1.5, 2.3, and 2.6 V/cm for the BL, BF, RUL, and FEAST electrode configurations, respectively, which coupled with the broad spread of the BL E-field suggests a biophysical basis for observations of superior efficacy of BL ECT compared to BF and RULED'; (2) in the hippocampi, BLECT produces a median E-field of 4.8 V/cm that is 1.5-2.8 times stronger than that for the other electrode configurations, consistent with the more pronounced amnestic effects of BL ECT; and (3) neglecting the WM conductivity anisotropy results in E-field strength error up to 18% overall and up to 39% in specific ROIs, motivating the inclusion of the WM conductivity anisotropy in accurate head models. This computational study demonstrates how the realistic finite element head model incorporating tissue conductivity anisotropy provides quantitative insight into the biophysics of ECT, which may shed light on the differential clinical outcomes seen with various forms of ECT, and may guide the development of novel stimulation paradigms with improved risk/benefit ratio.

TI Looming Signals Reveal Synergistic Principles of Multisensory
   Integration
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE
AB Multisensory interactions are a fundamental feature of brain organization. Principles governing multisensory processing have been established by varying stimulus location, timing and efficacy independently. Determining whether and how such principles operate when stimuli vary dynamically in their perceived distance (as when looming/receding) provides an assay for synergy among the above principles and also means for linking multisensory interactions between rudimentary stimuli with higher-order signals used for communication and motor planning. Human participants indicated movement of looming or receding versus static stimuli that were visual, auditory, or multisensory combinations while 160-channel EEG was recorded. Multivariate EEG analyses and distributed source estimations were performed. Nonlinear interactions between looming signals were observed at early poststimulus latencies (similar to 75 ms) in analyses of voltage waveforms, global field power, and source estimations. These looming-specific interactions positively correlated with reaction time facilitation, providing direct links between neural and performance metrics of multisensory integration. Statistical analyses of source estimations identified looming-specific interactions within the right claustrum/insula extending inferiorly into the amygdala and also within the bilateral cuneus extending into the inferior and lateral occipital cortices. Multisensory effects common to all conditions, regardless of perceived distance and congruity, followed (similar to 115 ms) and manifested as faster transition between temporally stable brain networks (vs summed responses to unisensory conditions). We demonstrate the early-latency, synergistic interplay between existing principles of multisensory interactions. Such findings change the manner in which to model multisensory interactions at neural and behavioral/perceptual levels. We also provide neurophysiologic backing for the notion that looming signals receive preferential treatment during perception.

TI Disparity-Specific Spatial Interactions: Evidence from EEG Source
   Imaging
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE
AB Using cortical source estimation techniques based on high-density EEG and fMRI measurements in humans, we measured how a disparity-defined surround influenced the responses to the changing disparity of a central disk within five visual ROIs: V1, V4, lateral occipital complex (LOC), hMT+, and V3A. The responses in the V1 ROI were not consistently affected either by changes in the characteristics of the surround (correlated or uncorrelated) or by its disparity value, consistent with V1 being responsive only to absolute, not relative, disparity. Correlation in the surround increased the responses in the V4, LOC, and hMT + ROIs over those measured with the uncorrelated surround. Thus, these extrastriate areas contain neurons that are sensitive to disparity differences. However, their evoked responses did not vary systematically with the surround disparity. Responses in the V3A ROI, in contrast, were increased by correlation in the surround and varied with its disparity. We modeled these V3A responses as attributable to a gain modulation of the absolute disparity response, where the gain amplitude is proportional to the center-surround disparity difference. An additional experiment identified a nonlinear center-surround interaction in V3A that facilitates the responses when center and surround are misaligned but suppresses it when they share the same disparity plane.

In this paper an iterative strategy is presented. The strategy is optimized to reconstruct brain activity confined in a sub region of the brain volume by jointly processing both bioelectric and biomagnetic signals. The procedure takes advantage from intermediate evaluations to improve the resolution, while limiting the number of unknowns. The advantages of the proposed approach is a higher robustness against noise and uncertainty and better effectiveness.

TI The Effect of Statistically Constrained Minimum Mean Square Estimation
   Algorithm Which is Used For Human Head Tissue Conductivity Estimation to
   Source Localization
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES-TURKISH
AB Determining the electrical active regions of human brain by using EEG and/or MEG data is known as "EEG/MEG bioelectromagnetic inverse problem" or "source localization". A typical source localization system intakes not only EEG/MEG data but also geometry information of subject/patient, a priori information about the electrically active sources, the number and 3-D positions of measurement electrodes and conductivities/resistivities of the tissues in the head model. In this study we investigated the conductivity estimation performance previously proposed Statistically Constrainted Minimum Mean Square Error Estimation (MiMSEE) algorithm by simulation studies and we also investigated the effect of the estimation to source localization activities. In simulation studies we used a three-layered (composed of scalp, skull and brain regions) realistic head model to estimate 100 different conductivity distributions in vivo. As a result we found that the proposed algorithm estimates the conductivity of scalp with an average error of 23%, the conductivity of skull with an average error of 40% and finally the conductivity of brain with an average error of 17%. In the second part of the study we compared the source localization errors for two cases: one, when the average conductivities of tissues given in the literature are used, and second when the subject-specific conductivity estimation is performed with MiMSEE algorithm. The results showed 10.1 mm localization error is obtained when the average conductivities given in the literature are used and 2.7 mm localization is obtained when subject-specific conductivity estimation is performed with MiMSEE algorithm. The results shows that the localization error is reduced by 73.07% when subject-specific conductivity estimation is performed with MiMSEE algorithm. We conclude that using the conductivities obtained from MiMSEE algorithm reduces the source localization error and we recommend to perform subject-specific conductivity estimation for source localization applications.

TI Methods for high-resolution anisotropic finite element modeling of the
   human head: Automatic MR white matter anisotropy-adaptive mesh
   generation
SO MEDICAL ENGINEERING & PHYSICS
AB This study proposes an advanced finite element (FE) head modeling technique through which highresolution FE meshes adaptive to the degree of tissue anisotropy can be generated. Our adaptive meshing scheme (called wMesh) uses MRI structural information and fractional anisotropy maps derived from diffusion tensors in the FE mesh generation process, optimally reflecting electrical properties of the human brain. We examined the characteristics of the wMeshes through various qualitative and quantitative comparisons to the conventional FE regular-sized meshes that are non-adaptive to the degree of white matter anisotropy. We investigated numerical differences in the FE forward solutions that include the electrical potential and current density generated by current sources in the brain. The quantitative difference was calculated by two statistical measures of relative difference measure (RDM) and magnification factor (MAC). The results show that the wMeshes are adaptive to the anisotropic density of the WM anisotropy, and they better reflect the density and directionality of tissue conductivity anisotropy. Our comparison results between various anisotropic regular mesh and wMesh models show that there are substantial differences in the EEG forward solutions in the brain (up to RDM = 0.48 and MAG = 0.63 in the electrical potential, and RDM = 0.65 and MAG = 0.52 in the current density). Our analysis results indicate that the wMeshes produce different forward solutions that are different from the conventional regular meshes. We present some results that the wMesh head modeling approach enhances the sensitivity and accuracy of the FE solutions at the interfaces or in the regions where the anisotropic conductivities change sharply or their directional changes are complex. The fully automatic wMesh generation technique should be useful for modeling an individual-specific and high-resolution anisotropic FE head model incorporating realistic anisotropic conductivity distributions towards more accurate analysis of bioelectromagnetic problems.

TI A Generalized Multivariate Autoregressive (GmAR)-Based Approach for EEG
   Source Connectivity Analysis
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING
AB Studying brain connectivity has provided new in-sights to the understanding of brain function. While connectivity measures are conventionally computed from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals directly, the presence of volume conduction represents a serious confound affecting interpretation of results. A common solution is to use a two-stage approach which involves estimating underlying brain sources from scalp EEG recordings and subsequently estimating the connectivity between the inferred sources. Recently, a state-space framework which jointly models the instantaneous mixing effects of volume conduction and the causal relationships between underlying brain sources is proposed. In this paper, we extend the state-space framework and model the source activity by a generalized multivariate autoregressive(mAR) process with possibly non-Gaussian noise. A maximum likelihood estimation approach is developed which allows simultaneous estimation of both the mixing matrix and AR model parameters directly from scalp EEG. The proposed technique was verified with simulated EEG data generated using the single-shell spherical head model and demonstrated improved estimation accuracies compared to conventional two-stage connectivity estimation approaches. Furthermore, the proposed technique was applied to EEG data collected from normal and Parkinson's subjects performing a right-handed force-tracking task with differing amounts of visual feedback. The partial directed coherence (PDC) between sources showed significant differences between groups and conditions. These results suggest that the proposed technique is a powerful method to extract connectivity information from EEG recordings.

TI Sequencing the cortical processing of pitch-evoking stimuli using EEG
   analysis and source estimation
SO FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB Cues to pitch include spectral cues that arise from tonotopic organization and temporal cues that arise from firing patterns of auditory neurons. fMRI studies suggest a common pitch center is located just beyond primary auditory cortex along the lateral aspect of Heschl's gyrus, but little work has examined the stages of processing for the integration of pitch cues. Using electroencephalography, we recorded cortical responses to high-pass filtered iterated rippled noise (IRN) and high-pass filtered complex harmonic stimuli, which differ in temporal and spectral content. The two stimulus types were matched for pitch saliency, and a mismatch negativity (MMN) response was elicited by infrequent pitch changes. The P1 and N1 components of event-related potentials (ERPs) are thought to arise from primary and secondary auditory areas, respectively, and to result from simple feature extraction. MMN is generated in secondary auditory cortex and is thought to act on feature-integrated auditory objects. We found that peak latencies of both P1 and N1 occur later in response to IRN stimuli than to complex harmonic stimuli, but found no latency differences between stimulus types for MMN. The location of each ERP component was estimated based on iterative fitting of regional sources in the auditory cortices. The sources of both the P1 and N1 components elicited by IRN stimuli were located dorsal to those elicited by complex harmonic stimuli, whereas no differences were observed for MMN sources across stimuli. Furthermore, the MMN component was located between the P1 and N1 components, consistent with fMRI studies indicating a common pitch region in lateral Heschl's gyrus. These results suggest that while the spectral and temporal processing of different pitch-evoking stimuli involves different cortical areas during early processing, by the time the object-related MMN response is formed, these cues have been integrated into a common representation of pitch.

TI Brain oscillations and functional connectivity during overt language
   production
SO FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB In the present study we investigate the communication of different large scale brain sites during an overt language production task with state of the art methods for the estimation of EEG functional connectivity. Participants performed a semantic blocking task in which objects were named in semantically homogeneous blocks of trials consisting of members of a semantic category (e.g., all objects are tools) or in heterogeneous blocks, consisting of unrelated objects. The classic pattern of slower naming times in the homogeneous relative to heterogeneous blocks is assumed to reflect the duration of lexical selection. For the collected data in the homogeneous and heterogeneous conditions the imaginary part of coherency (ImC) was evaluated at different frequencies. The ImC is a measure for detecting the coupling of different brain sites acting on sensor level. Most importantly, the ImC is robust to the artifact of volume conduction. We analyzed the ImC at all pairs of 56 EEG channels across all frequencies. Contrasting the two experimental conditions we found pronounced differences in the theta band at 7 Hz and estimated the most dominant underlying brain sources via a minimum norm inverse solution based on the ImC. As a result of the source localization, we observed connectivity between occipito-temporal and frontal areas, which are well-known to play a major role in lexical-semantic language processes. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of investigating interactive brain activity during overt language production.

TI Reference Estimation in EEG: Analysis of Equivalent Approaches
SO IEEE SIGNAL PROCESSING LETTERS
AB This letter demonstrates the theoretical equivalence between the different ICA/beamforming based solutions proposed in the literature for the reference-estimation problem in electroen-cephalographic (EEG) recordings [1]-[3]. By reference, we understand an unknown, non-null, time-varying potential, measured at the reference electrode situated sufficiently distant from the measuring electrodes. Despite the theoretical equivalence of the various approaches, they do not yield identical results in practice. This discrepancy is primarily due to the practical implementation of the underlying approach. We show in this context that the most reliable solution avoids blind source separation and montage transformation in addition to making full use of available a priori knowledge.

TI Noise in Brain Activity Engenders Perception and Influences
   Discrimination Sensitivity
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE
AB Behavioral and brain responses to identical stimuli can vary with experimental and task parameters, including the context of stimulus presentation or attention. More surprisingly, computational models suggest that noise-related random fluctuations in brain responses to stimuli would alone be sufficient to engender perceptual differences between physically identical stimuli. In two experiments combining psychophysics and EEG in healthy humans, we investigated brain mechanisms whereby identical stimuli are (erroneously) perceived as different (higher vs lower in pitch or longer vs shorter in duration) in the absence of any change in the experimental context. Even though, as expected, participants' percepts to identical stimuli varied randomly, a classification algorithm based on a mixture of Gaussians model (GMM) showed that there was sufficient information in single-trial EEG to reliably predict participants' judgments of the stimulus dimension. By contrasting electrical neuroimaging analyses of auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) to the identical stimuli as a function of participants' percepts, we identified the precise timing and neural correlates (strength vs topographic modulations) as well as intracranial sources of these erroneous perceptions. In both experiments, AEP differences first occurred similar to 100 ms after stimulus onset and were the result of topographic modulations following from changes in the configuration of active brain networks. Source estimations localized the origin of variations in perceived pitch of identical stimuli within right temporal and left frontal areas and of variations in perceived duration within right temporoparietal areas. We discuss our results in terms of providing neurophysiologic evidence for the contribution of random fluctuations in brain activity to conscious perception.

TI Cortical Representation of the Human Hand Assessed by Two Levels of
   High-Resolution EEG Recordings
SO HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING
AB Increasing interest in cortical plasticity has prompted the growing use of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) to estimate changes in the cortical representation of body regions. Here, we tested the effect of different sites of hand stimulation and of the density of spatial sampling in the quality of estimation of somatosensory sources. Sources of two SEP components from the primary somatosensory cortex (N20/P20 and P45) were estimated using two levels of spatial sampling (64- vs. 128-channel) and stimulation of four distal sites in the upper limbs, including single digits (first vs. fifth) and distal nerves with comparable cortical projection (superficial branch of the radial nerve and distal ulnar nerve). The most robust separation of somatosensory sources was achieved by comparing the cortical representations of the first digit and the distal ulnar nerve territories on the N20/P20 component of SEPs. Although both the 64- and the 128-electrode montages correctly discriminated these two areas, only the 128-electrode montage was able to significantly separate sources in the other cases, notably when using first versus fifth digit stimulation. Trustworthy distinction of cortical representations was not obtainable when using the P45 component, probably because of greater activation volume, radial orientation of sources in areas 1-2 and increased variability with attention and vigilance. Assessment of tangential SEP components to stimulation of first digit versus ulnar nerve appears the best option to assess plastic somatosensory changes, especially when using relatively low-electrode sampling.

TI Bayesian mixture models for source separation in MEG
SO INVERSE PROBLEMS
AB This paper discusses the problem of imaging electromagnetic brain activity from measurements of the induced magnetic field outside the head. This imaging modality, magnetoencephalography (MEG), is known to be severely ill posed, and in order to obtain useful estimates for the activity map, complementary information needs to be used to regularize the problem. In this paper, a particular emphasis is on finding non-superficial focal sources that induce a magnetic field that may be confused with noise due to external sources and with distributed brain noise. The data are assumed to come from a mixture of a focal source and a spatially distributed possibly virtual source; hence, to differentiate between those two components, the problem is solved within a Bayesian framework, with a mixture model prior encoding the information that different sources may be concurrently active. The mixture model prior combines one density that favors strongly focal sources and another that favors spatially distributed sources, interpreted as clutter in the source estimation. Furthermore, to address the challenge of localizing deep focal sources, a novel depth sounding algorithm is suggested, and it is shown with simulated data that the method is able to distinguish between a signal arising from a deep focal source and a clutter signal.

TI Electrophysiological correlates of non-symbolic numerical magnitude
   processing in children: Joining the dots
SO NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA
AB Whether and in what way enumeration processes differ for small and large sets of objects is still a matter of debate. In order to shed light on this issue. EEG data were obtained from 60 normally developing elementary school children. Adopting a standard non-symbolic numerical comparison paradigm allowed us to manipulate numerical distance between stimulus arrays for different quantity ranges, i.e. the subitizing, counting and estimation ranges. In line with the existing literature, the amplitudes of parietal positive going ERP components showed systematic effects of numerical distance, which did not depend on set size. In contrast to the similarities in surface distribution of electrophysiological activity across all number ranges, applying source localization we found distance related current density effects in inferior parietal processing systems to be similar for all numerical ranges, there was, however, considerable variation in the involvement of medial parietal and lateral occipital regions. The precuneus, which is known to be involved in visual imagery, showed distance effects exclusively for numerical comparisons on large set sizes. In contrast, the processing of small quantities and stimulus arrays arranged into canonical patterns relied on lateral occipital areas that are linked to higher-level shape recognition. These findings suggest, on the one hand, that for explicit numerical decisions an involvement of domain-specific resources does not depend on quantity features of the visual input. On the other hand, it seems that the recruitment of mediating perceptual systems differs between the apprehension of small quantities and the enumeration of large sets of objects.

TI Impaired early visual response modulations to spatial information in
   chronic schizophrenia
SO PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH-NEUROIMAGING
AB Early visual processing stages have been demonstrated to be impaired in schizophrenia patients and their first-degree relatives. The amplitude and topography of the P1 component of the visual evoked potential (VEP) are both affected; the latter of which indicates alterations in active brain networks between populations. At least two issues remain unresolved. First, the specificity of this deficit (and suitability as an endophenotype) has yet to be established, with evidence for impaired P1 responses in other clinical populations. Second, it remains unknown whether schizophrenia patients exhibit intact functional modulation of the P1 VEP component; an aspect that may assist in distinguishing effects specific to schizophrenia. We applied electrical neuroimaging analyses to VEPs from chronic schizophrenia patients and healthy controls in response to variation in the parafoveal spatial extent of stimuli. Healthy controls demonstrated robust modulation of the VEP strength and topography as a function of the spatial extent of stimuli during the P1 component. By contrast, no such modulations were evident at early latencies in the responses from patients with schizophrenia. Source estimations localized these deficits to the left precuneus and medial inferior parietal cortex. These findings provide insights on potential underlying low-level impairments in schizophrenia.

TI Insights from intermittent binocular rivalry and EEG
SO FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE
AB Novel stimulation and analytical approaches employed in EEG studies of ambiguous figures have recently been applied to binocular rivalry. The combination of intermittent stimulus presentation and EEG source imaging has begun to shed new light on the neural underpinnings of binocular rivalry. Here, we review the basics of the intermittent paradigm and highlight methodological issues important for interpreting previous results and designing future experiments. We then outline current analytical approaches, including EEG microstates, event-related potentials, and statistically based source estimation, and propose a neural model of the sequence of brain events that may underlie different aspects of binocular rivalry. Finally, we discuss the advantages and limitations of using binocular rivalry as a tool to investigate the neural basis of perceptual awareness.

TI Real-time feature extraction of P300 component using adaptive nonlinear
   principal component analysis
SO BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING ONLINE
AB Background: The electroencephalography (EEG) signals are known to involve the firings of neurons in the brain. The P300 wave is a high potential caused by an event-related stimulus. The detection of P300s included in the measured EEG signals is widely investigated. The difficulties in detecting them are that they are mixed with other signals generated over a large brain area and their amplitudes are very small due to the distance and resistivity differences in their transmittance.
   Methods: A novel real-time feature extraction method for detecting P300 waves by combining an adaptive nonlinear principal component analysis (ANPCA) and a multilayer neural network is proposed. The measured EEG signals are first filtered using a sixth-order band-pass filter with cut-off frequencies of 1 Hz and 12 Hz. The proposed ANPCA scheme consists of four steps: pre-separation, whitening, separation, and estimation. In the experiment, four different inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs) are utilized: 325 ms, 350 ms, 375 ms, and 400 ms.
   Results: The developed multi-stage principal component analysis method applied at the pre-separation step has reduced the external noises and artifacts significantly. The introduced adaptive law in the whitening step has made the subsequent algorithm in the separation step to converge fast. The separation performance index has varied from -20 dB to -33 dB due to randomness of source signals. The robustness of the ANPCA against background noises has been evaluated by comparing the separation performance indices of the ANPCA with four algorithms (NPCA, NSS-JD, JADE, and SOBI), in which the ANPCA algorithm demonstrated the shortest iteration time with performance index about 0.03. Upon this, it is asserted that the ANPCA algorithm successfully separates mixed source signals.
   Conclusions: The independent components produced from the observed data using the proposed method illustrated that the extracted signals were clearly the P300 components elicited by task-related stimuli. The experiment using 350 ms ISI showed the best performance. Since the proposed method does not use down-sampling and averaging, it can be used as a viable tool for real-time clinical applications.

TI General bounds for electrode mislocation on the EEG inverse problem
SO COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE
AB We analyze the effect of electrode mislocation on the electroencephalography (EEG) inverse problem using the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for single dipolar source parameters. We adopt a realistic head shape model, and solve the forward problem using the Boundary Element Method; the use of the CRB allows us to obtain general results which do not depend on the algorithm used for solving the inverse problem. We consider two possible causes for the electrode mislocation, errors in the measurement of the electrode positions and an imperfect registration between the electrodes and the scalp surfaces. For 120 electrodes placed in the scalp according to the 10-20 standard, and errors on the electrode location with a standard deviation of 5 mm, the lower bound on the standard deviation in the source depth estimation is approximately 1 mm in the worst case. Therefore, we conclude that errors in the electrode location may be tolerated since their effect on the EEG inverse problem are negligible from a practical point of view.

TI Rapid Consolidation and the Human Hippocampus: Intracranial Recordings
   Confirm Surface EEG
SO HIPPOCAMPUS
AB Diverse studies demonstrated that although immediately repeated stimuli are better and faster recognized than stimuli repeated after a delay, this comes at the price of less-efficient long-term retention. A recent-evoked potential study using source estimation of high-resolution scalp EEG indicated that while immediate repetition induced a strikingly different electrical activity than new items in the left-medial temporal lobe (MTL) after 200-300 ms, delayed repetition did not. In this study, we recorded evoked potentials in two epileptic patients with intracranial depth electrodes in diverse temporal and frontal areas as they performed the same task as in the previous study. We found that immediate repetition induced increase of neural activity specifically in the left MTL between 250 and 400 ms compared to new items and items repeated after a delay. The findings are important in two ways. First, they support our previous conclusion that novel information immediately initiates a consolidation process involving the left-hippocampal area, which remains vulnerable during active maintenance and increases its effectiveness during off-line processing. Second, they indicate that source estimation based on high-resolution scalp EEG correctly localizes the current source of electrical activity in midline structures like the MTL.

TI fMRI Functional Networks for EEG Source Imaging
SO HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING
AB The brain exhibits temporally coherent networks (TCNs) involving numerous cortical and sub-cortical regions both during the rest state and during the performance of cognitive tasks. TCNs represent the interactions between different brain areas, and understanding such networks may facilitate electroencephalography (EEG) source estimation. We propose a new method for examining TCNs using scalp EEG in conjunction with data obtained by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In this approach, termed NEtwork based SOurce Imaging (NESOI), multiple TCNs derived from fMRI with independent component analysis (ICA) are used as the covariance priors of the EEG source reconstruction using Parametric Empirical Bayesian (PEB). In contrast to previous applications of PEB in EEG source imaging with smoothness or sparseness priors, TCNs play a fundamental role among the priors used by NESOI. NESOI achieves an efficient integration of the high temporal resolution EEG and TCN derived from the high spatial resolution fMRI. Using synthetic and real data, we directly compared the performance of NESOI with other distributed source inversion methods, with and without the use of fMRI priors. Our results indicated that NESOI is a potentially useful approach for EEG source imaging. Hum Brain Mapp 32: 1141-1160, 2011. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

TI STATE-SPACE SOLUTIONS TO THE DYNAMIC MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY INVERSE
   PROBLEM USING HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING
SO ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS
AB Determining the magnitude and location of neural sources within the brain that are responsible for generating magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals measured on the surface of the head is a challenging problem in functional neuroimaging. The number of potential sources within the brain exceeds by an order of magnitude the number of recording sites. As a consequence, the estimates for the magnitude and location of the neural sources will be ill-conditioned because of the underdetermined nature of the problem. One well-known technique designed to address this imbalance is the minimum norm estimator (MNE). This approach imposes an L(2) regularization constraint that serves to stabilize and condition the source parameter estimates. However, these classes of regularizer are static in time and do not consider the temporal constraints inherent to the biophysics of the MEG experiment. In this paper we propose a dynamic state-space model that accounts for both spatial and temporal correlations within and across candidate intra-cortical sources. In our model, the observation model is derived from the steady-state solution to Maxwell's equations while the latent model representing neural dynamics is given by a random walk process. We show that the Kalman filter (KF) and the Kalman smoother [also known as the fixed-interval smoother (FIS)] may be used to solve the ensuing high-dimensional state-estimation problem. Using a well-known relationship between Bayesian estimation and Kalman filtering, we show that the MNE estimates carry a significant zero bias. Calculating these high-dimensional state estimates is a computationally challenging task that requires High Performance Computing (HPC) resources. To this end, we employ the NSF Teragrid Supercomputing Network to compute the source estimates. We demonstrate improvement in performance of the state-space algorithm relative to MNE in analyses of simulated and actual somatosensory MEG experiments. Our findings establish the benefits of high-dimensional state-space modeling as an effective means to solve the MEG source localization problem.

TI Evaluation of Algorithms for Intracranial EEG (iEEG) Source Imaging of
   Extended Sources: Feasibility of Using iEEG Source Imaging for
   Localizing Epileptogenic Zones in Secondary Generalized Epilepsy
SO BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY
AB Precise identification of epileptogenic zones in patients with intractable drug-resistant epilepsy is critical for successful epilepsy surgery. Numerous source-imaging algorithms for localizing epileptogenic zones based on scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) have been developed and validated in simulation and experimental studies. Recently, intracranial EEG (iEEG)-based imaging of epileptogenic sources has attracted interest as a promising tool for presurgical evaluation of epilepsy; however, most iEEG studies have focused on localization of epileptogenic zones in focal epilepsy. In the present study, we investigated whether iEEG source imaging is a useful supplementary tool for identifying extended epileptogenic sources in secondary generalized epilepsy such as Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). To this end, we applied four different cortical source imaging algorithms, namely minimum norm estimation (MNE), low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA), standardized LORETA (sLORETA), and L (p) -norm estimation (p = 1.5, referred to as Lp1.5), to artificial iEEG datasets generated assuming various source sizes and locations. We also applied these four algorithms to clinical ictal iEEG recordings acquired from a pediatric patient with LGS. Interestingly, the traditional MNE algorithm outperformed the other imaging algorithms in most of our experiments, particularly in cases when larger-sized sources were activated. Although sLORETA outperformed both LORETA and Lp1.5, its performance was not as good as that of MNE. Compared to the other algorithms, the performance of Lp1.5 decayed most rapidly as the source size increased. Our findings suggest that iEEG source imaging using MNE is a promising auxiliary tool for the identification of epileptogenic zones in secondary generalized epilepsy. We anticipate that our results will provide useful guidelines for selection of an appropriate imaging algorithm for iEEG source imaging studies.

TI Spectral signal space projection algorithm for frequency domain MEG and
   EEG denoising, whitening, and source imaging
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB MEG and EEG data contain additive correlated noise generated by environmental and physiological sources. To suppress this type of spatially coloured noise, source estimation is often performed with spatial whitening based on a measured or estimated noise covariance matrix. However, artifacts that span relatively small noise subspaces, such as cardiac, ocular, and muscle artifacts, are often explicitly removed by a variety of denoising methods (e.g., signal space projection) before source imaging. Here, we introduce a new approach, the spectral signal space projection ((SP)-P-3) algorithm, in which time-frequency (TF)-specific spatial projectors are designed and applied to the noisy TF-transformed data, and whitened source estimation is performed in the TF domain. The approach can be used to derive spectral variants of all linear time domain whitened source estimation algorithms. The denoised sensor and source time series are obtained by the corresponding inverse IF-transform. The method is evaluated and compared with existing subspace projection and signal separation techniques using experimental data. Altogether, S3P provides an expanded framework for MEG/EEG data denoising and whitened source imaging in both the time and frequency/scale domains. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Bayesian symmetrical EEG/fMRI fusion with spatially adaptive priors
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB In this paper, we propose a novel symmetrical EEG/fMRI fusion method which combines EEG and fMRI by means of a common generative model. We use a total variation (TV) prior to model the spatial distribution of the cortical current responses and hemodynamic response functions, and utilize spatially adaptive temporal priors to model their temporal shapes. The spatial adaptivity of the prior model allows for adaptation to the local characteristics of the estimated responses and leads to high estimation performance for the cortical current distribution and the hemodynamic response functions. We utilize a Bayesian formulation with a variational Bayesian framework and obtain a fully automatic fusion algorithm.

TI The temporal evolution of electromagnetic markers sensitive to the
   capacity limits of visual short-term memory
SO FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE
AB An electroencephalographic (EEG) marker of the limited contents of human visual short-term memory (VSTM) has previously been described. Termed contralateral delay activity, this consists of a sustained, posterior, negative potential that correlates with memory load and is greatest contralateral to the remembered hemifield. The current investigation replicates this finding and uses magnetoencephalography (MEG) to characterize its magnetic counterparts and their neural generators as they evolve throughout the memory delay. A parametric manipulation of memory load, within and beyond capacity limits, allows separation of signals that asymptote with behavioral VSTM performance from additional responses that contribute to a linear increase with set-size. Both EEG and MEG yielded bilateral signals that track the number of objects held in memory, and contralateral signals that are independent of memory load. In MEG, unlike EEG, the contralateral interaction between hemisphere and item load is much weaker, suggesting that bilateral and contralateral markers of memory load reflect distinct sources to which EEG and MEG are differentially sensitive. Nonetheless, source estimation allowed both the bilateral and the weaker contralateral capacity-limited responses to be localized, along with a load-independent contralateral signal. Sources of global and hemisphere-specific signals all localized to the posterior intraparietal sulcus during the early delay. However the bilateral load response peaked earlier and its generators shifted later in the delay. Therefore the hemifield-specific response may be more closely tied to memory maintenance while the global load response may be involved in initial processing of a limited number of attended objects, such as their individuation or consolidation into memory.

TI eConnectome: A MATLAB toolbox for mapping and imaging of brain
   functional connectivity
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS
AB We have developed a MATLAB-based toolbox, eConnectome (electrophysiological connectome), for mapping and imaging functional connectivity at both the scalp and cortical levels from the electroencephalogram (EEG), as well as from the electrocorticogram (ECoG). Graphical user interfaces were designed for interactive and intuitive use of the toolbox. Major functions of eConnectome include EEG/ECoG preprocessing, scalp spatial mapping, cortical source estimation, connectivity analysis, and visualization. Granger causality measures such as directed transfer function and adaptive directed transfer function were implemented to estimate the directional interactions of brain functional networks, over the scalp and cortical sensor spaces. Cortical current density inverse imaging was implemented using a generic realistic geometry brain-head model from scalp EEGs. Granger causality could be further estimated over the cortical source domain from the inversely reconstructed cortical source signals as derived from the scalp EEG. Users may implement other connectivity estimators in the framework of eConnectome for various applications. The toolbox package is open-source and freely available at http://econnectome.umn.edu under the GNU general public license for noncommercial and academic uses. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

TI Practical constraints on estimation of source extent with MEG
   beamformers
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB We aimed to determine practical constraints on the estimation of the spatial extent of neuronal activation using MEG beamformers. Correct estimation of spatial extent is a pre-requisite for accurate models of electrical activity, allows one to estimate current density, and enables non-invasive monitoring of functional recovery following stroke.
   The output of an MEG beamformer is maximum when the correct source model is used, so that the spatial extent of a source can in principal be determined through evaluation of different source models with the beamformer. Here, we simulated 275-channel MEG data using sources of varying spatial extents that followed the cortical geometry. These data were subsequently used to estimate the spatial extent of generic disc elements without knowledge of the underlying surface, and we compared these results to estimates based on cortical surface geometry (with and without error in surface location).
   We found that disc-shaped source models are too simplistic, particularly for areas with high curvature. For areas with low curvature spatial extent was underestimated, although on average there was a linear relationship between the true and estimated extent. In contrast, cortical surface models gave accurate predictions of spatial extent. However, adding small errors (>2 mm) to the estimated location of the cortical surface abolished this relationship between true and estimated extent, implying that accurate co-registration is needed with such models.
   Our results show that models exploiting surface information are necessary in order to model spatial extent and in turn current density, but in order to render such models applicable in practical situations, the accuracy of the cortical surface model itself needs to improve.

TI Comparison of noise-normalized minimum norm estimates for MEG analysis
   using multiple resolution metrics
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB Noise-normalization has been shown to partly compensate for the localization bias towards superficial sources in minimum norm estimation. However, it has been argued that in order to make inferences for the case of multiple sources, localization properties alone are insufficient. Instead, multiple measures of resolution should be applied to both point-spread and cross-talk functions (PSFs and CTFs). Here, we demonstrate that noise-normalization affects the shapes of PSFs, but not of CTFs. We evaluated PSFs and CTFs for the MNE, dSPM and sLORETA inverse operators, on the metrics dipole localization error (DLE), spatial dispersion (SD) and overall amplitude (OA). We used 306-channel MEG configurations obtained from 17 subjects in a real experiment, including individual noise covariance matrices and head geometries. We confirmed that for PSFs DLE improved after noise normalization, and is zero for sLORETA. However, SD was generally lower for the unnormalized MNE. OA distributions were similar for all three methods, indicating that all three methods may greatly underestimate some sources relative to others. The reliability of differences between methods across subjects was demonstrated using distributions of standard deviations and p-values from paired t-tests. As predicted, the shapes of CTFs were the same for all methods, reflecting the general resolution limits of the inverse problem. This means that noise-normalization is of no consequence where linear estimation procedures are used as "spatial filters." While low DLE is advantageous for the localization of a single source, or possibly a few spatially distinct sources, the benefit for the case of complex source distributions is not obvious. We suggest that software packages for source estimation should include comprehensive tools for evaluating the performance of different methods. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Decomposition of Neurological Multivariate Time Series by State Space
   Modelling
SO BULLETIN OF MATHEMATICAL BIOLOGY
AB Decomposition of multivariate time series data into independent source components forms an important part of preprocessing and analysis of time-resolved data in neuroscience. We briefly review the available tools for this purpose, such as Factor Analysis (FA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA), then we show how linear state space modelling, a methodology from statistical time series analysis, can be employed for the same purpose. State space modelling, a generalization of classical ARMA modelling, is well suited for exploiting the dynamical information encoded in the temporal ordering of time series data, while this information remains inaccessible to FA and most ICA algorithms. As a result, much more detailed decompositions become possible, and both components with sharp power spectrum, such as alpha components, sinusoidal artifacts, or sleep spindles, and with broad power spectrum, such as FMRI scanner artifacts or epileptic spiking components, can be separated, even in the absence of prior information. In addition, three generalizations are discussed, the first relaxing the independence assumption, the second introducing non-stationarity of the covariance of the noise driving the dynamics, and the third allowing for non-Gaussianity of the data through a non-linear observation function. Three application examples are presented, one electrocardigram time series and two electroencephalogram (EEG) time series. The two EEG examples, both from epilepsy patients, demonstrate the separation and removal of various artifacts, including hum noise and FMRI scanner artifacts, and the identification of sleep spindles, epileptic foci, and spiking components. Decompositions obtained by two ICA algorithms are shown for comparison.

TI Pre-stimulus beta oscillations within left posterior sylvian regions
   impact auditory temporal order judgment accuracy
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY
AB Both neural and behavioral responses to stimuli are influenced by the state of the brain immediately preceding their presentation, notably by pre-stimulus oscillatory activity. Using frequency analysis of high-density electroencephalogram coupled with source estimations, the present study investigated the role of pre-stimulus oscillatory activity in auditory spatial temporal order judgments (TOJ). Oscillations within the beta range (i.e. 18-23 Hz) were significantly stronger before accurate than inaccurate TOJ trials. Distributed source estimations identified bilateral posterior sylvian regions as the principal contributors to pre-stimulus beta oscillations. Activity within the left posterior sylvian region was significantly stronger before accurate than inaccurate TOJ trials. We discuss our results in terms of a modulation of sensory gating mechanisms mediated by beta activity. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Social vision: Sustained perceptual enhancement of affective facial cues
   in social anxiety
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB Heightened perception of facial cues is at the core of many theories of social behavior and its disorders. In the present study, we continuously measured electrocortical dynamics in human visual cortex, as evoked by happy, neutral, fearful, and angry faces. Thirty-seven participants endorsing high versus low generalized social anxiety (upper and lower tertiles of 2104 screened undergraduates) viewed naturalistic faces flickering at 17.5 Hz to evoke steady-state visual evoked potentials (ssVEPs), recorded from 129 scalp electrodes. Electrophysiological data were evaluated in the time-frequency domain after linear source space projection using the minimum norm method. Source estimation indicated an early visual cortical origin of the face-evoked ssVEP, which showed sustained amplitude enhancement for emotional expressions specifically in individuals with pervasive social anxiety. Participants in the low symptom group showed no such sensitivity, and a correlational analysis across the entire sample revealed a strong relationship between self-reported interpersonal anxiety/avoidance and enhanced visual cortical response amplitude for emotional, versus neutral expressions. This pattern was maintained across the 3500 ms viewing epoch, suggesting that temporally sustained, heightened perceptual bias towards affective facial cues is associated with generalized social anxiety.

Besides classical signal analysis tools such as adaptive supervised filtering, parametric or non-parametric spectral estimation, time-frequency analysis, the proposed ICA technique can be used for detection of a wide group of artifacts from EEG data. In this paper a new form of nonlinearity implemented in the infomax approach is presented. As it has been proven experimentally, the proposed new sigmoidal function can effectively detect the selected group of artifacts from EEGs and is an useful approach to speed up computations.

TI Single Trial Variability in Brain-Computer Interfaces Based on Motor
   Imagery: Learning in the Presence of Labeling Noise
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMAGING SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY
AB This article addresses the issue of learning efficient linear spatial filters and a classification function to match noninvasive electroencephalographic (EEG) signals to motor imagery tasks voluntarily performed by the subjects. The new perspective used in this article consists in releasing the widely accepted hypothesis stating that motor tasks-related brain activities should have similar time course across trials. This work proposes a learning model that takes into account two previously unconsidered sources of variability. First, the time course of the subject's brain activity, while performing a motor imagery task, will be considered as a trial-dependent variable. This means that the optimal time, defined as an amount of time after the trial cue, chosen to determine the task performed by the subject might be different between distinct trials. The second released hypothesis deals with the spectral discriminative brain response. Although usual learning methods do not allow any dependency between the optimal discriminative time and frequency bands, our model takes into account this possible source of variability. Therefore, the brain response in distinct frequency bands, e. g., in the mu band or beta band, could be used by the decision function at distinct instants. Based on this underlying enhanced model, we propose a two-step procedure. In the first step, the algorithm carefully analyzes, using cross-validation techniques, the training data to identify previously mentioned sources of variability. In the second step, the enhanced frequency-dependent linear spatial filters and the classification function are determined. As by-products of this analysis, substantial piece of knowledge about motor imagery is provided. First, the method allows the identification and quantification of labeling noise in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on motor imagery. Second, the algorithm gives a comparative estimation of the spectral time courses during motor imagery. This article makes an extensive use of the dataset I of BCI Competition IV, which took place in 2008. It consists of a training set and a test set of 59 EEG signals recording on four subjects while performing an asynchronous BCI experiment. The two-step procedure presented in this article is shown to significantly outperform a comparative naive approach. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

   Healthy Subjects
SO ZHURNAL VYSSHEI NERVNOI DEYATELNOSTI IMENI I P PAVLOVA
AB Event-related potentials (ERP) are informative indicators of higher nervous activity of healthy people and patients in pathological states. Traditionally, methods of ERP processing include peak-time characteristics, topographical mapping and localization of equivalent dipole sources. At the same time, estimation of ERP synchronization is complicated by a short duration of the process. The wavelet analysis makes it possible to overcome the disadvantages of the traditional Furrier analysis and to calculate characteristics of ERP synchronization, in particular, phase synchronization. A new approach to estimation of the auditory ERP in healthy persons is proposed in the article. The method is based on the analysis of phase wavelet-synchronization of ERP individual components under conditions of differentiation of different degrees of attention concentration in healthy persons.

TI Three-dimensional neuronal brain activity estimation using shrinking
   smooth weighted-minimum-norm focal underdetermined-system solver methods
SO OPTICAL ENGINEERING
AB A new nonparametric method, based on the smooth weighted-minimum-norm (WMN) focal underdetermined-system solver (FOCUSS), for electrical cerebral activity localization using electroencephalography measurements is proposed. This method iteratively adjusts the spatial sources by reducing the size of the lead-field and the weighting matrix. Thus, an enhancement of source localization is obtained, as well as a reduction of the computational complexity. The performance of the proposed method, in terms of localization errors, robustness, and computation time, is compared with the WMN-FOCUSS and nonshrinking smooth WMN-FOCUSS methods as well as with standard generalized inverse methods (unweighted minimum norm, WMN, and FOCUSS). Simulation results for single-source localization confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method with respect to the reconstruction accuracy of a simulated single dipole.

TI Study of the origin of short- and long-latency SSEP during recovery from
   brain ischemia in a rat model
SO NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS
AB Somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) have been established as an electrophysiological tool for the prognostication of neurological outcome in patients with hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. The early and late responses in SSEPs reflect the sequential activation of neural structures along the somatosensory pathway. This study reports that the SSEP can be separated into early (short-latency, SL) and late (long-latency, LL) responses using independent component analysis (ICA), based on the assumption that these components are generated from different neural sources. Moreover, this source separation into the SL and LL components allows analysis of electrophysiological response to brain injury, even when the SSEPs are severely distorted and SL and LL components get mixed. With the help of ICA decomposition and corrected peak estimation, the latency of LL-SSEP is shown to be predictive of long-term neurological outcome. Further, it is shown that the recovery processes of SL- and LL-SSEPs follow different dynamics, with the SL-SSEP restored earlier than LL-SSEP. We predict that the SL- and LL-SSEPs reflect the timing of the progression of evoked response through the thalamocortical pathway and as such respond differently depending upon injury and recovery of the thalamic and cortical regions, respectively.

TI Comparison of five directed graph measures for identification of leading

SO PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT
AB Directed graphs (digraphs) derived from interictal periods of intracerebral EEG (iEEG) recordings can be used to estimate the leading interictal epileptic regions for presurgery evaluations. For this purpose, quantification of the emittance contribution of each node to the rest of digraph is important. However, the usual digraph measures are not very well suited for this quantification. Here, we compare the efficiency of recently introduced local information (LI) measure and a new measure called total global efficiency with classical measures like global efficiency, local efficiency and node degree. For evaluation, the estimated leading interictal epileptic regions based on five measures are compared with seizure onset zones obtained by visual inspection of epileptologists for five patients. The comparison revealed the superior performance of the LI measure. We showed efficiency of different digraph measures for the purpose of source and sink node identification.

TI Variational Bayes for Spatiotemporal Identification of Event-Related
   Potential Subcomponents
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB We propose a novel method for detection and tracking of event-related potential (ERP) subcomponents. The ERP subcomponent sources are assumed to be electric current dipoles (ECDs), and their locations and parameters (amplitude, latency, and width) are estimated and tracked from trial to trial. Variational Bayes implies that the parameters can be estimated separately using the likelihood function of each parameter. Estimations of ECD locations, which have nonlinear relations to the measurement, are obtained by particle filtering. Estimations of the amplitude and noise covariance matrix of the measurement are optimally given by the maximum likelihood (ML) approach, while estimations of the latency and the width are obtained by the Newton-Raphson technique. New recursive methods are introduced for both the ML and Newton-Raphson approaches to prevent divergence in the filtering procedure where there is a very low SNR. The main advantage of the method is the ability to track varying ECD locations. The proposed method is assessed using simulated as well as real data, and the results emphasize the potential of this new approach for the analysis of real-time measures of neural activity.

TI Blind Extraction of Global Signal From Multi-Channel Noisy Observations
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS
AB We propose a novel efficient method of blind signal extraction from multi-sensor networks when each observed signal consists of one global signal and local uncorrelated signals. Most of existing blind signal separation and extraction methods such as independent component analysis have constraints such as statistical independence, non-Gaussianity, and underdetermination, and they are not suitable for global signal extraction problem from noisy observations. We developed an estimation algorithm based on alternating iteration and the smart weighted averaging. The proposed method does not have strong assumptions such as independence or non-Gaussianity. Experimental results using a musical signal and a real electroencephalogram demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method.

TI A parallel framework for simultaneous EEG/fMRI analysis: Methodology and
   simulation
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB Concurrent EEG/fMRI recordings represent multiple, simultaneously active, regionally overlapping neuronal mass responses. To address the problems caused by the overlapping nature of these responses, we propose a parallel framework for Spatial-Temporal EEG/fMRI Fusion (STEFF). This technique adopts Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to recover the time-course and spatial mapping components from EEG and fMRI separately. These components are then linked concurrently in the spatial and temporal domain using an Empirical Bayesian (EB) model. This approach enables information one modality to be utilized as priors for the other and hence improves the spatial (for EEG) or temporal (for fMRI) resolution of the other modality. Consequently, STEFF achieves flexible and sparse matching among EEG and fMRI components with common neuronal substrates. Simulations under realistic noise conditions indicated that STEFF is a feasible and physiologically reasonable hybrid approach for spatiotemporal mapping of cognitive processing in the human brain.

TI Meditation experience predicts less negative appraisal of pain:
   Electrophysiological evidence for the involvement of anticipatory neural
   responses
SO PAIN
AB The aim of mindfulness meditation is to develop present-focused, non-judgmental, attention. Therefore, experience in meditation should be associated with less anticipation and negative appraisal of pain. In this study we compared a group of individuals with meditation experience to a control group to test whether any differences in the affective appraisal of pain could be explained by lower anticipatory neural processing. Anticipatory and pain-evoked ERPs and reported pain unpleasantness were recorded in response to laser stimuli of matched subjective intensity between the two groups. ERP data were analysed after source estimation with LORETA. No group effects were found on the laser energies used to induce pain. More experienced meditators perceived the pain as less unpleasant relative to controls, with meditation experience correlating inversely with unpleasantness ratings. ERP source data for anticipation showed that in meditators, lower activity in midcingulate cortex relative to controls was related to the lower unpleasantness ratings, and was predicted by lifetime meditation experience. Meditators also reversed the normal positive correlation between medial prefrontal cortical activity and pain unpleasantness during anticipation. Meditation was also associated with lower activity in 52 and insula during the pain-evoked response, although the experiment could not disambiguate this activity from the preceding anticipation response. Our data is consistent with the hypothesis that meditation reduces the anticipation and negative appraisal of pain, but effects on pain-evoked activity are less clear and may originate from preceding anticipatory activity. Further work is required to directly test the causal relationship between meditation, pain anticipation, and pain experience. (C) 2010 International Association for the Study of Pain.

TI EEG-fMRI reciprocal functional neuroimaging
SO CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB Objective: Integration of electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been pursued in an effort to achieve greater spatio-temporal resolution of imaging dynamic brain activity. We report a data-driven approach to image spatio-temporal features of neural oscillatory activity and event-related activity from continuously recorded EEG and fMRI signals.
   Methods: This approach starts with using the independent component analysis (ICA) to decompose the spatio-temporal EEG data into a linear combination of scalp potential maps and time courses. The time course of each independent component (IC) is used to construct a regressor to fit the fMRI time series. The resultant fMRI map then feeds back as a spatial constraint to the estimation of the source distribution underlying the corresponding IC's scalp map. The estimated source distributions multiplied by the corresponding IC time courses are summed across all ICs, giving rise to the reconstructed spatio-temporal brain activity. Functional connectivity between cortical areas can be further revealed from the imaged source signals using phase synchrony measures. We tested the method using both simulated oscillatory activity and event-related neural activity at various cortical regions. We also used this method to study the alpha-band EEG modulations in an eyes-open-eyes-closed human experiment.
   Results: In the simulation study, reliable reconstruction of the localization, time-frequency feature and cortical functional connection were achieved for the simulated oscillatory and event-related activities. In the experimental study, the alpha rhythmic modulation was localized mainly in the occipital visual area and the parieto-occipital sulcus. Within these regions, time-frequency analysis and phase-synchronization analysis indicated increased alpha power and alpha-band phase-synchronization in eyes-closed condition versus eyes-open condition.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that the proposed approach is well suited to image continuously oscillatory activities and their functional connectivity.
   Significance: Such ability promises to facilitate the investigation of the long-term neural behaviors and large-scale cortical interactions involved in spontaneous brain activity and cognitive tasks.

TI The Role of the Cingulate Cortex as Neural Generator of the N200 and
   P300 in a Tactile Response Inhibition Task
SO HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING
AB Both the N200 and P300, which are, for example, evoked by Go/Nogo or Stop-Signal tasks, have long been interpreted as indicators for inhibition processes. Such interpretations have recently been challenged, and interest in the exact neural generators of these brain responses is continuously growing. Using recent methodological advancements, source estimations for the N200 and P300 as evoked by a tactile response inhibition task were computed. Current density reconstructions were also calculated accounting for interindividual differences in head geometry by incorporating information from T1-weighted magnetic resonance images. To ease comparability with relevant paradigms, the task was designed to mimic important characteristics of both Go/Nogo and Stop-Signal tasks as prototypes for a larger set of paradigms probing response inhibition. A network of neural generators was revealed, which has previously been shown to act in concert with executive control processes and thus is in full agreement with observations from other modalities. Importantly, a spatial segregation of midcingulate sources was observed. Our experimental data indicate that a left anterior region of the midcingulate cortex (MCC) is a major neural generator of the N200, whereas the midcingulate generator of the P300 is located in the right posterior MCC. Analyses of the P300 also revealed several areas, which have previously been associated with motor functions, for example, the precentral region. Our data clearly suggest a neuroanatomical and therefore also functional dissociation of the N200 and P300, a finding that cannot easily be provided by other imaging techniques.

TI Influence of skull conductivity perturbations on EEG dipole source
   analysis
SO MEDICAL PHYSICS
AB Purpose: Electroencephalogram (EEG) source analysis is a noninvasive technique used in the presurgical of epilepsy. In this study, the dipole location and orientation errors due to skull conductivity perturbations were investigated in two groups of three-dimensional head models: A spherical head model and a realistic head model.
   Methods: In each group, the head model had a brain-to-skull conductivity ratio (R(sigma)) within the range of 10-40. Solving the forward problem in the head model with skull conductivity perturbations along with the inverse problem in the baseline head model with R(sigma)=20 permitted the derivation of the dipole estimation errors.
   Results: Perturbations in the skull conductivity generated dipole location and orientation errors: The larger the perturbations, the larger the errors and the error ranges. The dipole orientation error due to skull conductivity perturbations was not great (maximal mean of <5 degrees) in this study, but the dipole location error was notable (maximal mean of >5 mm).
   Conclusions: Therefore, the influence of skull conductivity perturbations on EEG dipole source analysis cannot be neglected. This study suggests that it is necessary to measure the skull conductivity of the individual patients in order to achieve accurate EEG source analysis.

AB We propose a novel method, fMRI-Informed Regional Estimation (FIRE), which utilizes information from fMRI in E/MEG source reconstruction FIRE takes advantage of the spatial alignment between the neural and the vascular activities. while allowing for substantial differences in their dynamics Furthermore, with a region-based approach, FIRE estimates the model parameters for each region independently Hence, it can be efficiently applied on a dense grid of source locations The optimization procedure at the core of FIRE is related to the re-weighted minimum-norm algorithms The weights in the proposed approach are computed from both the current source estimates and fMRI data, leading to robust estimates in the presence of silent sources in either fMRI or E/MEG measurements We employ a Monte Carlo evaluation procedure to compare the proposed method to several other joint E/MEG-fMRI algorithms Our results show that FIRE provides the best trade-off in estimation accuracy between the spatial and the temporal accuracy Analysis using human E/MEG-fMRI data reveals that FIRE significantly reduces the ambiguities in source localization present in the minimum-norm estimates, and that it accurately captures activation timing in adjacent functional regions (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

TI Divergent Cortical Generators of MEG and EEG during Human Sleep Spindles
   Suggested by Distributed Source Modeling
SO PLOS ONE
AB Background: Sleep spindles are similar to 1-second bursts of 10-15 Hz activity, occurring during normal stage 2 sleep. In animals, sleep spindles can be synchronous across multiple cortical and thalamic locations, suggesting a distributed stable phase-locked generating system. The high synchrony of spindles across scalp EEG sites suggests that this may also be true in humans. However, prior MEG studies suggest multiple and varying generators.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We recorded 306 channels of MEG simultaneously with 60 channels of EEG during naturally occurring spindles of stage 2 sleep in 7 healthy subjects. High-resolution structural MRI was obtained in each subject, to define the shells for a boundary element forward solution and to reconstruct the cortex providing the solution space for a noise-normalized minimum norm source estimation procedure. Integrated across the entire duration of all spindles, sources estimated from EEG and MEG are similar, diffuse and widespread, including all lobes from both hemispheres. However, the locations, phase and amplitude of sources simultaneously estimated from MEG versus EEG are highly distinct during the same spindles. Specifically, the sources estimated from EEG are highly synchronous across the cortex, whereas those from MEG rapidly shift in phase, hemisphere, and the location within the hemisphere.
   Conclusions/Significance: The heterogeneity of MEG sources implies that multiple generators are active during human sleep spindles. If the source modeling is correct, then EEG spindles are generated by a different, diffusely synchronous system. Animal studies have identified two thalamo-cortical systems, core and matrix, that produce focal or diffuse activation and thus could underlie MEG and EEG spindles, respectively. Alternatively, EEG spindles could reflect overlap at the sensors of the same sources as are seen from the MEG. Although our results generally match human intracranial recordings, additional improvements are possible and simultaneous intra-and extra-cranial measures are needed to test their accuracy.

TI Magnetoencephalography Source Localization Using the Source Affine Image
   Reconstruction (SAFFIRE) Algorithm
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB Nonparametric iterative algorithms have been previously proposed to achieve high-resolution, sparse solutions to the bioelectromagnetic inverse problem applicable to multichannel magnetoencephalography and EEG recordings. Using a mmse estimation framework, we propose a new algorithm of this type denoted as source affine image reconstruction (SAFFIRE) aiming to reduce the vulnerability to initialization bias, augment robustness to noise, and decrease sensitivity to the choice of regularization. The proposed approach operates in a normalized lead-field space and employs an initial estimate based on matched filtering to combat the potential biasing effect of previously proposed initialization methods. SAFFIRE minimizes difficulties associated with the selection of the most appropriate regularization parameter by using two separate loading terms: a fixed noise-dependent term that can be directly estimated from the data and arises naturally from the mmse formulation, and an adaptive term (adjusted according to the update of the source estimate) that accounts for uncertainties of the forward model in real-experimental applications. We also show that a noncoherent integration scheme can be used within the SAFFIRE algorithm structure to further enhance the reconstruction accuracy and improve robustness to noise.

TI Interhemispheric coupling between the posterior sylvian regions impacts
   successful auditory temporal order judgment
SO NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA
AB Accurate perception of the temporal order of sensory events is a prerequisite in numerous functions ranging from language comprehension to motor coordination. We investigated the spatio-temporal brain dynamics of auditory temporal order judgment (aTOJ) using electrical neuroimaging analyses of auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) recorded while participants completed a near-threshold task requiring spatial discrimination of left-right and right-left sound sequences. AEPs to sound pairs modulated topographically as a function of aTOJ accuracy over the 39-77 ms post-stimulus period, indicating the engagement of distinct configurations of brain networks during early auditory processing stages. Source estimations revealed that accurate and inaccurate performance were linked to bilateral posterior sylvian regions activity (PSR). However, activity within left, but not right, PSR predicted behavioral performance suggesting that left PSR activity during early encoding phases of pairs of auditory spatial stimuli appears critical for the perception of their order of occurrence. Correlation analyses of source estimations further revealed that activity between left and right PSR was significantly correlated in the inaccurate but not accurate condition, indicating that aTOJ accuracy depends on the functional decoupling between homotopic PSR areas. These results support a model of temporal order processing wherein behaviorally relevant temporal information - i.e. a temporal 'stamp' - is extracted within the early stages of cortical processes within left PSR but critically modulated by inputs from right PSR. We discuss our results with regard to current models of temporal of temporal order processing, namely gating and latency mechanisms. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI A method for the estimation of functional brain connectivity from
   time-series data
SO COGNITIVE NEURODYNAMICS
AB A central issue in cognitive neuroscience is which cortical areas are involved in managing information processing in a cognitive task and to understand their temporal interactions. Since the transfer of information in the form of electrical activity from one cortical region will in turn evoke electrical activity in other regions, the analysis of temporal synchronization provides a tool to understand neuronal information processing between cortical regions. We adopt a method for revealing time-dependent functional connectivity. We apply statistical analyses of phases to recover the information flow and the functional connectivity between cortical regions for high temporal resolution data. We further develop an evaluation method for these techniques based on two kinds of model networks. These networks consist of coupled Rossler attractors or of coupled stochastic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck systems. The implemented time-dependent coupling includes uni- and bi-directional connectivities as well as time delayed feedback. The synchronization dynamics of these networks are analyzed using the mean phase coherence, based on averaging over phase-differences, and the general synchronization index. The latter is based on the Shannon entropy. The combination of these with a parametric time delay forms the basis of a connectivity pattern, which includes the temporal and time lagged dynamics of the synchronization between two sources. We model and discuss potential artifacts. We find that the general phase measures are remarkably stable. They produce highly comparable results for stochastic and periodic systems. Moreover, the methods proves useful for identifying brief periods of phase coupling and delays. Therefore, we propose that the method is useful as a basis for generating potential functional connective models.

TI Plastic brain mechanisms for attaining auditory temporal order judgment
   proficiency
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB Accurate perception of the order of occurrence of sensory information is critical for the building up of coherent representations of the external world from ongoing flows of sensory inputs. While some psychophysical evidence reports that performance on temporal perception can improve, the underlying neural mechanisms remain unresolved. Using electrical neuroimaging analyses of auditory evoked potentials (AEPs), we identified the brain dynamics and mechanism supporting improvements in auditory temporal order judgment (TOJ) during the course of the first vs. latter half of the experiment. Training-induced changes in brain activity were first evident 43-76 ms Post stimulus onset and followed from topographic, rather than pure strength, AEP modulations. Improvements in auditory TOJ accuracy thus followed from changes in the configuration of the underlying brain networks during the initial stages of sensory processing. Source estimations revealed an increase in the lateralization of initially bilateral posterior sylvian region (PSR) responses at the beginning of the experiment to left-hemisphere dominance at its end. Further supporting the critical role of left and right PSR in auditory TOJ proficiency, as the experiment progressed, responses in the left and Fight PSR went from being correlated to un-correlated. These collective findings provide insights on the neurophysiologic mechanism and plasticity of temporal processing of sounds and are consistent with models based on spike timing dependent plasticity.

TI EEG-fMRI Fusion of Paradigm-Free Activity Using Kalman Filtering
SO NEURAL COMPUTATION
AB We address here the use of EEG and fMRI, and their combination, in order to estimate the full spatiotemporal patterns of activity on the cortical surface in the absence of any particular assumptions on this activity such as stimulation times. For handling such a high-dimension inverse problem, we propose the use of (1) a global forward model of how these measures are functions of the "neural activity" of a large number of sources distributed on the cortical surface, formalized as a dynamical system, and (2) adaptive filters, as a natural solution to solve this inverse problem iteratively along the temporal dimension. This estimation framework relies on realistic physiological models, uses EEG and fMRI in a symmetric manner, and takes into account both their temporal and spatial information.
   We use the Kalman filter and smoother to perform such an estimation on realistic artificial data and demonstrate that the algorithm can handle the high dimensionality of these data and that it succeeds in solving this inverse problem, combining efficiently the information provided by the two modalities (this information being naturally predominantly temporal for EEG and spatial for fMRI). It performs particularly well in reconstructing a random temporally and spatially smooth activity spread over the cortex.
   The Kalman filter and smoother show some limitations, however, which call for the development of more specific adaptive filters. First, they do not cope well with the strong nonlinearity in the model that is necessary for an adequate description of the relation between cortical electric activities and the metabolic demand responsible for fMRI signals. Second, they fail to estimate a sparse activity (i.e., presenting sharp peaks at specific locations and times). Finally their computational cost remains high. We use schematic examples to explain these limitations and propose further developments of our method to overcome them.

TI A Spatiotemporal Framework for MEG/EEG Evoked Response Amplitude and
   Latency Variability Estimation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB This paper presents a spatiotemporal framework for estimating single-trial response latencies and amplitudes from evoked response magnetoencephalographic/electroencephalographic data. Spatial and temporal bases are employed to capture the aspects of the evoked response that are consistent across trials. Trial amplitudes are assumed independent but have the same underlying normal distribution with unknown mean and variance. The trial latency is assumed to be deterministic but unknown. We assume that the noise is spatially correlated with unknown covariance matrix. We introduce a generalized expectation-maximization algorithm called Trial Variability in Amplitude and Latency (TriViAL) that computes the maximum likelihood (ML) estimates of the amplitudes, latencies, basis coefficients, and noise covariance matrix. The proposed approach also performs ML source localization by scanning the TriViAL algorithm over spatial bases corresponding to different locations on the cortical surface. Source locations are identified as the locations corresponding to large likelihood values. The effectiveness of the TriViAL algorithm is demonstrated using simulated data and human evoked response experiments. The localization performance is validated using tactile stimulation of the finger. The efficacy of the algorithm in estimating latency variability is shown using the known dependence of the M100 auditory response latency to stimulus tone frequency. We also demonstrate that estimation of response amplitude is improved when latency is included in the signal model.

TI EEG source analysis of chronic fatigue syndrome
SO PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH-NEUROIMAGING
AB Sixty-one dextral, unmedicated women with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) diagnosed according to the Fukuda criteria (1994) and referred for investigation by rheumatologists and internists were studied with quantitative EEG (43 channels) at rest with eyes open and during verbal and spatial cognitive activation. The EEGs from the patients were compared with recordings from 80 dextral healthy female controls. Only those subjects who could provide 20 1-s artefact-free segments of EEG were admitted into the study. The analysis consisted of the identification of the spatial patterns in the EEGs that maximally differentiated the two groups and the estimation of the cortical source distributions underlying these patterns. Spatial patterns were analyzed in the alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta (14-20 Hz) bands and the source distributions were estimated using the Borgiotti-Kaplan BEAMFORMER algorithm. The results indicate that the spatial patterns identified were effective in separating the two groups, providing a minimum correct retrospective classification rate of 72% in both frequency bands while the subjects were at rest to a maximum of 83% in the alpha band during the verbal cognitive condition. Underlying cortical source distributions showed significant differences between the two groups in both frequency bands and in all cognitive conditions. Lateralized cortical differences were evident between the two groups in the both frequency bands during both the verbal and spatial cognitive conditions. During these active cognitive conditions, the CFS group showed significantly greater source-current activity than the controls in the left frontal-temporal-parietal regions of the cortex.

TI Improving human brain mapping via joint inversion of brain
   electrodynamics and the BOLD signal
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB We present several methods to improve the resolution OF human brain mapping by combining information obtained from surface electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the same participants performing the same task in separate Imaging sessions. As an initial step in our methods we used independent component analysis (ICA) to obtain task-related sources for both EEG and fMRI We then used that information in an integrated cost function that attempts to match both data sources and trades goodness of fit in one regime for another We compared the performance and drawbacks of each method in localizing sources for a dual visual evoked response experiment, and we contrasted the results Of adding fMRI information to simple EEG-only inversion methods We found that adding fMRI information in a variety of ways gives Superior results 10 Classical norm source estimation. Our findings lead its to favor a method which attempts to match EEG scalp dynamics along with voxel power obtained from ICA-processed blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) data: this method of joint inversion enables LIS to treat the two data sources as symmetrically as possible.

TI Interlaced resolution scheme for the simultaneous analysis of brain
   electric activity and conductivity with combined EEG/MEG diagnostics
SO COMPEL-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR COMPUTATION AND MATHEMATICS IN
   ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the performances of a resolution scheme able to follow the dynamics of brain tissue properties in combined ElectroEncefaloGraphic (EEG) - MagnetoEncefaloGraphic (MEG) techniques for the brain analysis, minimizing the computation burden.
   Design/methodology/approach - The estimation process in combined EEG-MEG is performed by a Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse computation. This is affected by the uncertain knowledge of the living tissues' electric properties. In principle, it is possible to estimate those properties from the EEG-MEG signals. The estimation process becomes in this case non-linear. A resolution scheme is proposed, based on the exploitation of the different dynamics characterizing sources and tissues properties.
   Findings - The proposed resolution scheme provides a reasonable estimate of the sources for a computationally affordable frequency of non-liner estimations.
   Research limitations/implications - The proposed approach has not been tested yet on experimental data, and as such, its sensitivity to environmental uncertainty is not known yet.
   Practical implications - The proposed strategy can be easily implemented to perform realistic measurement processing.
   Originality/value - The paper presents a novel strategy to estimate tissues properties and EEG-MEG signal sources based on the exploitation of their different dynamics, possibly taking advantages from an impedance tomography preliminary analysis for the tissue properties dynamics.

TI Robust Bayesian estimation of the location, orientation, and time course
   of multiple correlated neural sources using MEG
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB The synchronous brain activity measured via MEG (or EEG) can be interpreted as arising from a collection (possibly large) of current dipoles or sources located throughout the cortex. Estimating the number, location, and time Course of these Sources remains a challenging task, one that is significantly compounded by the effects of source correlations and unknown orientations and by the presence of interference from spontaneous brain activity, sensor noise, and other artifacts. This paper derives an empirical Bayesian method for addressing each of these issues in a principled fashion. The resulting algorithm guarantees descent of a cost function uniquely designed to handle unknown orientations and arbitrary correlations. Robust interference suppression is also easily incorporated. In a restricted setting, the proposed method is shown to produce theoretically zero reconstruction error estimating multiple dipoles even in the presence of strong correlations and unknown orientations, unlike a variety of existing Bayesian localization methods or common signal processing techniques such as beamforming and sLORETA. Empirical results on both simulated and real data sets verify the efficacy of this approach. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Fairness concerns predict medial frontal negativity amplitude in
   ultimatum bargaining
SO SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE
AB Despite evidence that anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activity is related to social exclusion, rejection and unfairness, evidence that medial frontal negativity (MFN), which has its source in the ACC, reflects these constructs remains unforthcoming. In the present study, subjects participated as recipients in an ultimatum game, while we recorded their electro-encephalogram (EEG). Participants responded to fair and unfair offers from different human proposers. In addition, participants rated themselves on a measure evaluating their concern for fairness. Results showed that MFN amplitude was more pronounced for unfair offers compared to fair offers. Moreover, this effect was shown to be most pronounced for subjects with high concerns for fairness. Our findings suggest that the MFN not only reflects whether outcomes match expectations, but also reflects whether the process by which these outcomes came about matches a social or even a moral norm. In addition, the present results suggest that people in bargaining situations are not only concerned with their own outcomes, but are also concerned with the fairness of the process that resulted in these outcomes.

TI Gaussian source model based iterative algorithm for EEG source imaging
SO COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
AB Estimation of the neural active sources from the scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) is an ill-posed inverse problem. In this paper, we propose a new source model: Gaussian distributed Source Model (GSM), to model the activations in brain. GSM may imitate an Isolated Source Model (ISM) or a Distributed Source Model (DSM) by adopting different supporting range parameter of the Gaussian function. Using GSM, an iterative Gaussian source Imaging Algorithm (GIA) is developed to detect the EEG sources. As GIA dynamically reduces the solution space, the solution may gradually converge to a desired distribution. A comparative evaluation among LORETA, FOCUSS and GIA was conducted for both isolated point sources and distributed sources, the results demonstrate that GIA is more flexible and efficient for various actual sources configurations. Finally. GSM was applied to real recordings obtained from a visual spatial attention task: the corresponding source activation areas of the early component are localized in contralateral occipital cortices, consistent with the retinotopic organization of early visual spatial attention effects.

TI Dipole estimation errors due to not incorporating anisotropic
   conductivities in realistic head models for EEG source analysis
SO PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
AB EEG source analysis is a valuable tool for brain functionality research and for diagnosing neurological disorders, such as epilepsy. It requires a geometrical representation of the human head or a head model, which is often modeled as an isotropic conductor. However, it is known that some brain tissues, such as the skull or white matter, have an anisotropic conductivity. Many studies reported that the anisotropic conductivities have an influence on the calculated electrode potentials. However, few studies have assessed the influence of anisotropic conductivities on the dipole estimations. In this study, we want to determine the dipole estimation errors due to not taking into account the anisotropic conductivities of the skull and/or brain tissues. Therefore, head models are constructed with the same geometry, but with an anisotropically conducting skull and/or brain tissue compartment. These head models are used in simulation studies where the dipole location and orientation error is calculated due to neglecting anisotropic conductivities of the skull and brain tissue. Results show that not taking into account the anisotropic conductivities of the skull yields a dipole location error between 2 and 25 mm, with an average of 10 mm. When the anisotropic conductivities of the brain tissues are neglected, the dipole location error ranges between 0 and 5 mm. In this case, the average dipole location error was 2.3 mm. In all simulations, the dipole orientation error was smaller than 10 degrees. We can conclude that the anisotropic conductivities of the skull have to be incorporated to improve the accuracy of EEG source analysis. The results of the simulation, as presented here, also suggest that incorporation of the anisotropic conductivities of brain tissues is not necessary. However, more studies are needed to confirm these suggestions.

TI Repetition suppression and plasticity in the human brain
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB The suppression of neuronal responses to a repeated event is a ubiquitous phenomenon in neuroscience. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unexplored. The aim of this study was to examine the temporal evolution of experience-dependent changes in connectivity induced by repeated stimuli. We recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) during frequency changes of a repeating tone. Bayesian inversion of dynamic causal models (DCM) of ERPs revealed systematic repetition-dependent changes in both intrinsic and extrinsic connections, within a hierarchical cortical network. Critically, these changes occurred very quickly, over interstimulus intervals that implicate short-term synaptic plasticity. Furthermore, intrinsic (within-source) connections showed biphasic changes that were Much faster than changes in extrinsic (between-source) connections, which decreased monotonically with repetition. This study shows that auditory perceptual learning is associated with repetition-dependent plasticity in the human brain. It is remarkable that distinct changes in intrinsic and extrinsic connections could be quantified so reliably and non-invasively using EEG. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Three-way matrix analysis, the MUSIC algorithm and the coupled dipole
   model
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS
AB The inverse problem of multi-channel MEG/EEG data is considered as a parameter estimation problem. The stability of the solution of the inverse problem, which decreases with the number of included dipoles, can be improved by either adding constraints to the model parameters, or by adding more data of related data sets. The latter approach was taken by Bijma et al. [Bijma F, de Munck JC, Bocker KBE, Huizenga HM, Heethaar RM. The coupled dipole model: an integrated model for multiple MEG/EEG data sets. NeuroImage 2004;23(3):890-904; Bijma F, de Munck JC, Huizenga HM, Heethaar RM, Nehorai A. Simultaneous estimation and testing in multiple MEG data sets. IEEE Trans SP 2005;53(9):3449-60] by introducing coupling matrices that link dipole parameters and source time functions of different data sets.
   Here, the theoretical foundations of the coupled dipole model are explored and the MUSIC algorithm is generalised to the analysis of multiple related data sets. Similar to the MUSIC algorithm, the number of sources and the number of constraints are derived from the data by considering the minimum possible residual error as a function of the number of sources and constraints. However, contrary to the MUSIC algorithm, where the minimum residual error can be obtained from an SVD analysis of a two-way data matrix, here we deal with multiple data sets and therefore three-way matrix analysis is used.
   From a simulation study it appears that the number of sources and constraints can be clearly determined from a generalised SVD analysis. The generalisation of the MUSIC algorithm to three-way data gives reasonable estimates of the dipole parameters. These results can be used in the simultaneous analysis of MEG/EEG data of multiple subjects, multiples data sets of the same subject or models where subsequent trials of data show habituation effects.

TI Improved EEG Source Analysis Using Low-Resolution Conductivity
   Estimation in a Four-Compartment Finite Element Head Model
SO HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING
AB Bioelectric source analysis in the human brain from scalp electroencephalography (EEG) signals is sensitive to geometry and conductivity properties of the different head tissues. We propose a low-resolution conductivity estimation (LRCE) method using simulated annealing optimization on high-resolution finite element models that individually optimizes a realistically shaped four-layer volume conductor with regard to the brain and skull compartment conductivities. As input data, the method needs T1- and PD-weighted magnetic resonance images for an improved modeling of the skull and the cerebrospinal fluid compartment and evoked potential data with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Our simulation Studies showed that for EEG data with realistic SNR, the LRCE method was able to simultaneously reconstruct both the brain and the skull conductivity together with the underlying dipole source an provided an improved source analysis result. We have also demonstrated the feasibility and applicability of the new method to simultaneously estimate brain and skull conductivity and a somatosensory source from measured tactile somatosensory-evoked potentials of a human subject. Our results show the viability of an approach that computes its own conductivity Values and thus reduces the dependence on assigning values from the literature and likely produces a more robust estimate of current sources. Using the LRCE method, the individually optimized four-compartment volume conductor model can, in a second step, be used for the analysis of clinical or cognitive data acquired from the same subject.

TI Inverse Modeling on Decomposed Electroencephalographic Data: A Way
   Forward?
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB Inverse modeling is typically applied to instantaneous electroencephalogram signals. However. this approach has several shortcomings including its instability to model multiple and deep located dipole sources and the interference of background noise may hamper the Sensitivity, stability, and precision of the estimated dipoles. This article validates different dipole estimation techniques to find the most optimal combination of different analysis principles using both Simulations and recordings. Electroencephalogram data were simulated with six known Source locations. First, a dataset was simulated With Sources chosen to mimic somatosensory-evoked potentials to electrical stimuli. Additionally, 20 further datasets Were simulated each containing six randomly located and oriented Sources. The simulated sources included superficial, deep, and simultaneously active Sources. Furthermore, somatosensory-evoked potentials to median nerve stimuli were recorded from one subject. On both simulated and recorded evoked potential data, three different methods of signal decomposition were compared: independent component analysis (ICA), second-order blind identification (SOBI), and multichannel matching pursuit (NIMP). For inverse modeling of the brain Sources. the DIPFIT function of the EEGLAB software was used on raw and decomposed data. MMP was able to separate all simulated components that corresponded to superficial, deep, and simultaneously active Sources. ICA and SOBI were only able to find components that Corresponded to superficial Sources. For the 20 randomized simulations, the results from the evoked potential simulation were reproduced. Inverse modeling oil NIMP components (atoms) was better than oil ICA or SOBI components (P < 0.001) DIPFIT on MMP atoms localized 99.2% of the simulated dipoles in correct areas with their correct time/frequency distribution. DIPFIT on ICA and SOBI components localized 35%, and 39.6%, respectively of the simulated dipoles in correct areas. As for the real-evoked potentials recorded in one subject, DIPFIT oil MMP atoms allowed LIS to build a dipole model closer to the Current physiological knowledge than dipole modeling of ICA and SOBI components. The results show that using MMP before inverse modeling is a reliable way to noninvasively estimate cortical activation.

TI Objective selection of EEG late potentials through residual dependence
   estimation of independent components
SO PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT
AB This paper presents a novel method to objectively select electroencephalographic (EEG) cortical sources estimated by independent component analysis (ICA) in event-related potential (ERP) studies. A proximity measure based on mutual information is employed to estimate residual dependences of the components that are then hierarchically clustered based on these residual dependences. Next, the properties of each group of components are evaluated at each level of the hierarchical tree by two indices that aim to assess both cluster tightness and physiological reliability through a template matching process. These two indices are combined in three different approaches to bring to light the hierarchical structure of the cluster organizations. Our method is tested on a set of experiments with the purpose of enhancing late positive ERPs elicited by emotional picture stimuli. Results suggest that the best way to look for physiologically plausible late positive potential (LPP) sources is to explore in depth the tightness of those clusters that, taken together, best resemble the template. According to our results, after brain sources clustering, LPPs are always identified more accurately than from ensemble-averaged raw data. Since the late components of an ERP involve the same associative areas, regardless of the modality of stimulation or specific tasks administered, the proposed method can be simply adapted to other ERP studies, and extended from psychophysiological studies to pathological or sport training evaluation support.

TI Removing muscle and eye artifacts using blind source separation
   techniques in ictal EEG source imaging
SO CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB Objective: The contamination of muscle and eye artifacts during an ictal period of the EEG significantly distorts source estimation algorithms. Recent blind source separation (BSS) techniques based on canonical correlation (BSS-CCA) and independent component analysis with spatial constraints (SCICA) have shown much promise in the removal of these artifacts. In this study we want to use BSS-CCA and SCICA as a preprocessing step before the source estimation during the ictal period.
   Methods: Both the contaminated and cleaned ictal EEG were subjected to the RAP-MUSIC algorithm. This is a Multiple dipole source estimation technique based on the separation of the EEG in signal and noise subspace. The source estimates were compared with the subtracted ictal SPECT (iSPECT) coregistered to magnetic resonance imaging (SISCOM) by means of the euclidean distance between the iSPECT activations and the dipole location estimates. SISCOM results in an image denoting the ictal onset zone with a propagation.
   Results: We applied the artifact removal and the source estimation on 8 patients. Qualitatively, we can see that 5 out of 8 patients show an improvement of the dipoles. The dipoles are nearer to or have tighter clusters near the iSPECT activation. From the median of the distance measure, we could appreciate that 5 out of 8 patients show improvement.
   Conclusions: The results show that BSS-CCA and SCICA can be applied to remove artifacts, but the results should be interpreted with care. The results of the source estimation can be misleading due to excessive noise or modeling errors. Therefore, the accuracy of the source estimation can be increased by preprocessing the ictal EEG segment by BSS-CCA and SCICA.
   Significance: This is a pilot study where EEG source localization in the presurgical evaluation can be made more reliable, if preprocessing techniques such as BSS-CCA and SCICA are used prior to EEG source analysis on ictal episodes.

TI 3D source localization derived from subdural strip and grid electrodes:
   A simulation study
SO CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB Objective: Little experience exists in the application of source reconstruction methods to recordings from subdural strip and grid electrodes. This Study addressed the question, whether reliable and accurate 3D source localization is possible from the Electrocorticogram (ECoG).
   Methods: The accuracy of source reconstruction was investigated by simulations and a case study. Simulated sources were used to compute potentials at the electrode positions derived from the MRI of a patient with subdural electrodes. Used procedures were the linear estimation (minimum norm) algorithm and the MUSIC (MUltiple SIgnal Classification) scan.
   Results: Maxima of linear estimation were attracted to adjacent electrodes. Reliable localization with a localization error <= 15 mm was only achieved for about 35% of the original source positions. Maxima of the MUSIC metric were identical to original positions for simulations without noise. Noise reduced the percentage of reliable solutions down to a 79.0%. Electrode contacts distant to the source had small influence on localization accuracy. The case study supported simulation results.
   Conclusion: Reliable source reconstruction derived from ECoG can be achieved by the application of the MUSIC algorithm. Linear estimation needs additional compensation mechanisms.
   Significance: MUSIC based 3D localization based on ECoG has the potential improving epilepsy diagnosis and cognitive research. (C) 2009 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Reconstructing cortical current density by exploring sparseness in the
   transform domain
SO PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
AB In the present study, we have developed a novel electromagnetic source imaging approach to reconstruct extended cortical sources by means of cortical current density (CCD) modeling and a novel EEG imaging algorithm which explores sparseness in cortical source representations through the use of L1-norm in objective functions. The new sparse cortical current density (SCCD) imaging algorithm is unique since it reconstructs cortical sources by attaining sparseness in a transform domain (the variation map of cortical source distributions). While large variations are expected to occur along boundaries ( sparseness) between active and inactive cortical regions, cortical sources can be reconstructed and their spatial extents can be estimated by locating these boundaries. We studied the SCCD algorithm using numerous simulations to investigate its capability in reconstructing cortical sources with different extents and in reconstructing multiple cortical sources with different extent contrasts. The SCCD algorithm was compared with two L2-norm solutions, i.e. weighted minimum norm estimate (wMNE) and cortical LORETA. Our simulation data from the comparison study show that the proposed sparse source imaging algorithm is able to accurately and efficiently recover extended cortical sources and is promising to provide high-accuracy estimation of cortical source extents.

TI White-Matter Lesions Along the Cholinergic Tracts are Related to
   Cortical Sources of EEG Rhythms in Amnesic Mild Cognitive Impairment
SO HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING
AB Does impairment of cholinergic systems represent an important factor in the development of amnesic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), as a preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD)? Here we tested the hypothesis that electroencephalographic (EEG) rhythms, known to be modulated by the cholinergic system, may be particularly affected in aMCI patients with lesions along the cholinergic white-matter tracts. Eyes-closed resting EEG data were recorded in 28 healthy elderly (Nold) and 57 aMCI patients. Lesions along the cholinergic white-matter tracts were detected with fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences on magnetic resonance imaging. The estimation of the cholinergic lesion was performed with a validated semi-automatic algorithm pipeline after registration to a stereotactic template, image integration with stereotactic masks of the cholinergic tracts, and normalization to intracranial volume. The aMCI patients were divided into two groups of high (MCI Ch+; N = 29; MMSE = 26.2) and low cholinergic damage (MCI Ch-; N = 28; MMSE = 26.6). EEG rhythms of interest were delta (2-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha 1 (8-10.5 Hz), alpha 2 (10.5-13 Hz), beta 1 (13-20 Hz), and beta 2 (20-30 Hz). Cortical EEG generators were estimated by LORETA software. As main results, (i) power of occipital, parietal, temporal, and limbic alpha 1 sources was maximum in Nold, intermediate in MCI Ch-, and low in MCI Ch+ patients; (ii) the same trend was true in theta sources. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that damage to the cholinergic system is associated with alterations of EEG sources in aMCI subjects. Hum Brain Mapp 30:1431-1443, 2009.

TI Influence of Ocular Filtering in EEG Data on the Assessment of
   Drug-Induced Effects on the Brain
SO HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING
AB Ocular artifacts in EEG signals affect the interpretation of clinical study results. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of automatic ocular filtering procedures in the conclusions drawn from a pharmaco-EEG trial. Regression analysis, gold standard, and blind source separation (BSS), Second Order Blind Identification algorithm, ocular filtering procedures were compared using time, frequency, topographic and tomographic brain mapping approaches and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) relationships. Data consisted of EEGs obtained from 20 volunteers who received single oral doses of haloperidol 3 mg, risperidone 1 mg, olanzapine 5 mg and placebo in a randomized crossover double-blind design. Although the BSS-based technique preserved brain activity more than regression analysis in anterior leads, in general, topographic significance probability maps globally showed similar results with both methods for most spectral variables. However, different results were obtained when using whole multi-channel information for studying drug effects in the brain: (i) higher correlations between PK and PD time courses showing that BSS allowed estimation of spectral variables more accurately related to drug effects and (ii) larger and more symmetric drug related tomographic LORETA maps showing that BSS led to results that were more neurophysiopharmacologically sound. Definitely, the BSS-based procedure is an effective and efficient preprocessing method to remove ocular artifacts from EEG data. The selection of the ocular filtering procedure could determine different results whose impact depends on the evaluating tool applied to analyze the pharmaco-EEG data.

TI Solving the ECG Forward Problem by Means of Standard h- and
   h-Hierarchical Adaptive Linear Boundary Element Method: Comparison With
   Two Refinement Schemes
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB The boundary element method (BEM) is a commonly used numerical approach to solve biomedical electromagnetic volume conductor models such as ECG and EEG problems, in which only the interfaces between various tissue regions need to be modeled. The quality of the boundary element discretization affects the accuracy of the numerical solution, and the construction of high-quality meshes is time-consuming and always problem-dependent. Adaptive BEM (aBEM) has been developed and validated as an effective method to tackle such problems in electromagnetic and mechanical fields, but has not been extensively investigated in the ECG problem. In this paper, the h aBEM, which produces refined meshes through adaptive adjustment of the elements' connection, is investigated for the ECG forward problem. Two different refinement schemes: adding one new node (SH1) and adding three new nodes (SH3), are applied for the h aBEM calculation. In order to save the computational time, the h-hierarchical aBEM is also used through the introduction of the h-hierarchical shape functions for SH3. The algorithms, were evaluated with a single-layer homogeneous sphere model with assumed dipole sources and a geometrically realistic heart-torso model. The simulations showed that h aBEM can produce better mesh results and is more accurate and effective than the traditional BEM for the ECG problem. While with the same refinement scheme SH3, the h-hierarchical aBEM can save the computational costs about 9% compared to the implementation of standard h aBEM.

TI Validation of regression-based myogenic correction techniques for scalp
   and source-localized EEG
SO PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY
AB EEG and EEG source-estimation are susceptible to electromyographic artifacts (EMG) generated by the cranial muscles. EMG can mask genuine effects or masquerade as a legitimate effect-even in low frequencies, such as alpha (8-13 Hz). Although regression-based correction has been used previously, only cursory attempts at validation exist, and the utility for source-localized data is unknown. To address this, EEG was recorded from 17 participants while neurogenic and myogenic activity were factorially varied. We assessed the sensitivity and specificity of four regression-based techniques: between-subjects, between-subjects using difference-scores, within-subjects condition-wise, and within-subject epoch-wise on the scalp and in data modeled using the LORETA algorithm. Although within-subject epoch-wise showed superior performance on the scalp, no technique succeeded in the source-space. Aside from validating the novel epoch-wise methods on the scalp, we highlight methods requiring further development.

TI Source Estimates for MEG/EEG Visual Evoked Responses Constrained by
   Multiple, Retinotopically-Mapped Stimulus Locations
SO HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING
AB Studying the human Visual system with high temporal resolution is a significant challenge due to the limitations of the available, noninvasive measurement tools. MEG and EEG provide the millisecond temporal resolution necessary for answering questions about intracortical communication involved in visual processing, but source estimation is ill-posed and unreliable when multiple; simultaneously active areas are located close together. To address this problem, we have developed a retinotopy-constrained source estimation method to calculate the time courses of activation in multiple visual areas. Source estimation was disambiguated by: (1) fixing MEG/EEG generator locations and orientations based on fMRI retinotopy and surface tessellations constructed from high-resolution MRI images; and (2) solving for many visual field locations simultaneously in MEG/EEG responses, assuming source current amplitudes to be constant or varying smoothly across the Visual field. Because of these constraints on the solutions, estimated Source waveforms become less sensitive to sensor noise or random errors in the specification of the retinotopic dipole models. We demonstrate the feasibility of this method and discuss future applications such as studying the timing of attentional modulation in individual visual areas. Hum Brain Mapp 30:1290-1309, 2009.

TI A hierarchical Bayesian method to resolve an inverse problem of MEG
   contaminated with eye movement artifacts
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB The magnetic fields generated by eye movements are major artifacts in MEG measurements. We propose a hybrid hierarchical variational Bayesian method to remove eye movement artifacts from MEG data. Our method is an extension of the hierarchical variational Bayesian method for MEG source localization proposed by Sato et al. [Sato, M., Yoshioka, T., Kajihara, S., Toyama, K., Goda, N., Doya, K., and Kawato, M., (2004). Hierarchical Bayesian estimation for MEG inverse problem. NeuroImage 23(3), 806-826]. First, we assumed a single dipole at each left and right eyeball as a source of eye artifacts. Second, we constructed an EOG forward model describing the relationship between eye dipoles and electric potentials, i.e., EOG. Based on the Bayesian framework, the proposed method concurrently estimates eye and brain current sources from both MEG and EOG data. Thereby the brain current sources can be isolated from eye artifacts. The new method was tested in two ways. In the simulation experiments, the performance of eye artifact removal was evaluated from various aspects; locations of brain current sources, temporal correlation between eye and brain current sources, the level of MEG observation noise and so on. In real MEG experiments, we measured MEG and EOG data during smooth pursuit eye movements for a horizontally or circularly moving target. Our method successfully removed eye artifacts from the simulated and real MEG data with the estimation of brain current sources that were located in eye movement related areas. Our method should be widely applicable to MEG data obtained in tasks with non-negligible eye movements. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Simulated power spectral density (PSD) of background electrocorticogram
   (ECoG)
SO COGNITIVE NEURODYNAMICS
AB The ECoG background activity of cerebral cortex in states of rest and slow wave sleep resembles broadband noise. The power spectral density (PSD) then may often conform to a power-law distribution: a straight line in coordinates of log power vs. log frequency. The exponent, x, of the distribution, 1/f(x), ranges between 2 and 4. These findings are explained with a model of the neural source of the background activity in mutual excitation among pyramidal cells. The dendritic response of a population of interactive excitatory neurons to an impulse input is a rapid exponential rise and a slow exponential decay, which can be fitted with the sum of two exponential terms. When that function is convolved as the kernel with pulses from a Poisson process and summed, the resulting "brown'' or "black noise conforms to the ECoG time series and the PSD in rest and sleep. The PSD slope is dependent on the rate of rise. The variation in the observed slope is attributed to variation in the level of the background activity that is homeostatically regulated by the refractory periods of the excitatory neurons. Departures in behavior from rest and sleep to action are accompanied by local peaks in the PSD, which manifest emergent nonrandom structure in the ECoG, and which prevent reliable estimation of the 1/f(x) exponents in active states. We conclude that the resting ECoG truly is low-dimensional noise, and that the resting state is an optimal starting point for defining and measuring both artifactual and physiological structures emergent in the activated ECoG.

TI A Spatiotemporal Framework for Estimating Trial-to-Trial Amplitude
   Variation in Event-Related MEG/EEG
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB A spatiotemporal framework for estimating trial-to-trial variability in evoked response (ER) data is presented. Spatial and temporal bases capture the aspects of the response that are consistent across trials, while the basis expansion coefficients represent the variable components of the response. We focus on the simplest case of constant spatiotemporal response shape and varying amplitude across trials. Two different constraints on the amplitude evolution are employed to effectively integrate the individual responses and improve robustness at low SNR. The linear dynamical system response constraint estimates the current trial amplitude as an unknown constant scaling of the estimate in the previous trial plus zero-mean Gaussian noise with unknown variance. The independent response constraint estimates response amplitudes across trials as independent Gaussian random variables having unknown mean and variance. We develop a generalized expectation-maximization algorithm to obtain the maximum-likelihood (ML) estimates of the signal waveform, noise covariance matrix, and unknown constraint parameters. ML source localization is achieved by scanning the likelihood over different sets of spatial bases. We demonstrate the variability estimation and source localization effectiveness of the proposed algorithms using both real and simulated ER data.

TI Assessing time-dependent association between scalp EEG and muscle
   activation: A functional random-effects model approach
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS
AB This study investigates time-dependent associations between source strength estimated from high-density scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) and force of voluntary handgrip contraction at different intensity levels. We first estimate source strength from raw EEG signals collected during voluntary muscle contractions at different levels and then propose a functional random-effects model approach in which both functional fixed effects and functional random-effects are considered for the data. Two estimation procedures for the functional model are discussed. The first estimation procedure is a two-step method which involves no iterations. it can flexibly use different smoothing methods and smoothing parameters. The second estimation procedure benefits from the connection between linear mixed models and regression splines and can be fitted using existing software. Functional ANOVA is then suggested to assess the experimental effects from the functional point of view. The statistical analysis shows that the time-dependent source strength function exhibits a nonlinear feature, where a bump is detected around the force onset time. However, there is the lack of significant variations in source strength on different force levels and different cortical areas. The proposed functional random-effects model procedure can be applied to other types of functional data in neuroscience. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI An ERP investigation of the Stroop task: The role of the cingulate in
   attentional allocation and conflict resolution
SO BRAIN RESEARCH
AB The majority of studies support a role of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in the attentional control necessary for conflict resolution in the Stroop task; however, the time course of activation and the neural substrates underlying the Stroop task remain contentious. We used high-density EEG to record visual-evoked potentials from 16 healthy subjects while performing a manual version of the traditional Stroop colour-word task. Difference waveforms for congruent-control and incongruent-control conditions were similar in amplitude and had a similar spatial distribution in the time window of 260-430 ms post stimulus onset. Source estimation indicated particularly middle cingulate involvement in congruent-control and incongruent-control difference waveforms. In contrast, the difference waveform for the incongruent-congruent contrast was observed later (in the time window of 370-480 ms), had a different spatial distribution, and source estimation indicated that the anterior cingulate underlies this difference waveform. As congruent-control and incongruent-control differences have a similar timeframe and cingulate source, we propose that this indicates early attentional allocation processes. That is, the identification of two sources of information (the word and the colour it is printed in) and the selective attention to one. The later peak in the incongruent-congruent difference wave, originating in anterior cingulate, likely reflects identification (and subsequent resolution) of conflict in the two sources of information.

TI An investigation of the phase locking index for measuring of
   interdependency of cortical source signals recorded in the EEG
SO BIOLOGICAL CYBERNETICS
AB The phase locking index (PLI) was introduced to quantify in a statistical sense the phase synchronization of two signals. It has been commonly used to process biosignals. In this article, we investigate the PLI for measuring the interdependency of cortical source signals (CSSs) recorded in the Electroencephalogram (EEG). To this end, we consider simple analytical models for the mapping of simulated CSSs into the EEG. For these models, the PLI is investigated analytically and through numerical simulations. An evaluation is made of the sensitivity of the PLI to the amount of crosstalk between the sources through biological tissues of the head. It is found that the PLI is a useful interdependency measure for CSSs, especially when the amount of crosstalk is small. Another common interdependency measure is the coherence. A direct comparison of both measures has not been made in the literature so far. We assess the performance of the PLI and coherence for estimation and detection purposes based on, respectively, a normalized variance and a novel statistical measure termed contrast. Based on these performance measures, it is found that the PLI is similar or better than the CM in most cases. This result is also confirmed through analysis of EEGs recorded from epileptic patients.

TI A unified Bayesian framework for MEG/EEG source imaging
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB The ill-posed nature of the MEG (or related EEG) source localization problem requires the incorporation of prior assumptions when choosing an appropriate solution out of an infinite set of candidates. Bayesian approaches are useful in this capacity because they allow these assumptions to be explicitly quantified using postulated prior distributions. However, the means by which these priors are chosen, as well as the estimation and inference procedures that are subsequently adopted to affect localization, have led to a daunting array of algorithms with seemingly very different properties and assumptions. From the vantage point of a simple Gaussian scale mixture model with flexible covariance components, this paper analyzes and extends several broad categories of Bayesian inference directly applicable to source localization including empirical Bayesian approaches, standard MAP estimation, and multiple variational Bayesian (VB) approximations. Theoretical properties related to convergence, global and local minima, and localization bias are analyzed and fast algorithms are derived that improve upon existing methods. This perspective leads to explicit connections between many established algorithms and suggests natural extensions for handling unknown dipole orientations, extended source configurations, correlated sources, temporal smoothness, and computational expediency. Specific imaging methods elucidated under this paradigm include the weighted minimum l(2)-norm, FOCUSS, minimum current estimation, VESTAL, sLORETA, restricted maximum likelihood, covariance component estimation, beamforming, variational Bayes, the Laplace approximation, and automatic relevance determination, as well as many others. Perhaps surprisingly, all of these methods can be formulated as particular cases of covariance component estimation using different concave regularization terms and optimization rules, making general theoretical analyses and algorithmic extensions/improvements particularly relevant.

TI Can I have a quick word? Early electrophysiological manifestations of
   psycholinguistic processes revealed by event-related regression analysis
   of the EEG
SO BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY
AB We applied multiple linear regression analysis to event-related electrophysiological responses to words and pseudowords in a visual lexical decision task, yielding event-related regression coefficients (ERRCs) instead of the traditional event-related potential (ERP) measure. Our main goal was to disentangle the earliest ERP effects of the length of letter strings ("word length") and orthographic neighbourhood size (Coltheart's "N"). With respect to N, existing evidence is still ambiguous with respect to whether effects of N reflect early access to lexico-semantic information, or whether they occur at later decision or verification stages. In the present study, we found distinct neurophysiological manifestations of both N and word length around 100 ms after word onset. Importantly, the effect of N distinguished between words and pseudowords, while the effect of word length did not. Minimum norm source estimation revealed the most dominant sources for word length in bilateral posterior brain areas for both words and pseudowords. For N, these sources were more left-lateralised and consistent with perisylvian brain areas, with activation peaks in temporal areas being more anterior for words compared to pseudowords. Our results support evidence for an effect of N at early and elementary stages of word recognition. We discuss the implications of these results for the time line of word recognition processes, and emphasise the value of ERRCs in combination with source analysis in psycholinguistic and cognitive brain research.

   CAPABILITIES
SE International Review of Neurobiology
AB This review introduces readers to fundamentals of electroencephalography (EEC), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). EEG and MEG signals are mainly produced by postsynaptic ionic currents of synchronically active pyramidal cortical neurons. These signals reflect the integrative information processing of neurons representing the output of cortical neural modules. EEG and MEG signals have a high temporal resolution (<1 ms) ideal to investigate an emerging propriety of brain physiology, namely the brain rhythms. A background spontaneous oscillatory activity of brain neurons at about 10 Hz generates dominant alpha rhythms of resting-state EEG and MEG activity. This background activity is blocked during sensory and cognitive-motor events. Standard EEG shows a low spatial resolution (5-9 cm), which partially improves by high-resolution EEG including 61-128 channels and source estimation techniques (1-3 cm); source estimation of MEG data shows a better spatial resolution (0.5-2 cm). fMRI is an indirect measurement of regional brain activity based on the ratio between deoxyhemoglobin and oxyhemoglobin blood (BOLD) during events referenced to baseline conditions. Event-related BOLD response has low temporal resolution (>1 s) and quite high spatial resolution (<1 cm), and is especially suitable to investigate spatial details of both cortical and subcortical activation.

TI Cortical Source Localization of Infant Cognition
SO DEVELOPMENTAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGY
AB Neuroimaging techniques such as positron emission topography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have been utilized with older children and adults to identify cortical sources of perceptual and cognitive processes. However, due to practical and ethical concerns, these techniques cannot be routinely applied to infant participants. An alternative to such neuroimaging techniques appropriate for use with infant participants is high-density electroencephalogram (EEG) recording and cortical source localization techniques. The current article provides an overview of a method developed for such analyses. The method consists of four steps: (1) recording high-density (e.g., 128-channel) EEG. (2) Analysis of individual participant raw segmented data with independent component analysis (ICA). (3) Estimation of equivalent current dipoles (ECDs) that represent cortical sources for the observed ICA component clusters. (4) Calculation of component activations in relation to experimental factors. We discuss an example of research applying this technique to investigate the development of visual attention and recognition memory. We also describe the application of realistic head modeling to address some of the current limitations of infant cortical source localization.

   Electromagnetism
CY SEP, 2008
CL Ilmenau, GERMANY
AB Purpose: This paper proposes an approach for the coupled EEG-MEG data analysis that takes into account the anisotropy of brain tissues and the different sensitivities of EEG and MEG measurements.
   Design/methodology/approach: The study is carried out by using a combination of analytical and numerical methods. In particular, where available, closed solutions are used to evaluate the numerical errors, while FEM models are used where anisotropy and geometrical characteristics make analytical solutions not applicable.
   Findings: The impact of tissues anisotropy on coupled EEG-MEG analysis has been assessed, and the effectiveness of an approach based on smart exploitation of different EEG and MEG sensitivity to improve sources reconstruction has been demonstrated numerically.
   Research limitations/implications: The analysis has been carried out using a spherical head model, and on simulated data.
   Practical implications: The proposed approach allows to improve the localization of equivalent sources for the description of cellular brain activity.
   Originality/value: The properties of objective functions used in brain sources reconstruction from EEG and MEG has been investigated taking into account tissues anisotropy in the spherical symmetric case. In addition a formulation of the joint source and tissues tensor conductivity estimation by exploiting simultaneously bioelectric and biomagnetic measurements based on the complementary sensitivity of those measurements has been presented.

TI Right hemispheric dominance for echo suppression
SO NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA
AB When two sounds are presented sequentially within a short delay (similar to 10 ms), the listener perceives a single auditory event, the location of which is dominated by the directional information conveyed by the leading sound (the precedence effect, PE). The PE is not always instantaneous, but has been shown to build-up across repetitions of lead-lag pairs. Here, we investigated the contributions of lateralization cue (interaural time and intensity differences; ITD and IID, respectively) and the side of lateralization of the leading sound on the spatio-temporal activity associated with the PE. We applied electrical neuroimaging analyses to compare auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) in response to physically identical click pairs presented early and late within a stimulus train and perceived as two segregated events or as one fused auditory event. Significant topographic AEP modulations associated with the PE were observed over the 70-117 ms post-stimulus period, with one topography characterizing fused perceptions and another segregated perceptions. The specific pattern of effects varied as a function of lateralization cue and the lateralization of the leading sound. The PE for ITD stimuli built-up during the stimulus train irrespective of the lateralization of the leading sound. The PE for IID stimuli did not exhibit build-up over the course of the stimulus train, but instead was generally affected by the lateralization of the leading sound. Source estimations further suggested that bilateral temporal networks were engaged when perceptions were segregated, whereas fused perceptions resulted in decreased activity in left temporal and increased activity in right temporo-parietal cortices.

TI Conditionally Gaussian Hypermodels for Cerebral Source Localization
SO SIAM JOURNAL ON IMAGING SCIENCES
AB Bayesian modeling and analysis of the magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography modalities provide a flexible framework for introducing prior information complementary to the measured data. This prior information is often qualitative in nature, making the translation of the available information into a computational model a challenging task. We propose a generalized gamma family of hyperpriors which allows the impressed currents to be focal and we advocate a fast and efficient iterative algorithm, the iterative alternating sequential algorithm for computing maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates. Furthermore, we show that for particular choices of the scalar parameters specifying the hyperprior, the algorithm effectively approximates popular regularization strategies such as the minimum current estimate and the minimum support estimate. The connection between priorconditioning and adaptive regularization methods is also pointed out. The posterior densities are explored by means of a Markov chain Monte Carlo strategy suitable for this family of hyper-models. The computed experiments suggest that the known preference of regularization methods for superficial sources over deep sources is a property of the MAP estimators only, and that estimation of the posterior mean in the hierarchical model is better adapted for localizing deep sources.

TI An experimental study on the effect of the anisotropic regions in a
   realistically shaped torso phantom
SO ANNALS OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB Determination of electrically active regions in the human body by observing generated bioelectric and/or biomagnetic signals is known as source reconstruction. In the reconstruction process, it is assumed that the volume conductor consists of isotropic compartments and homogeneous tissue bioelectric parameters but this assumption introduces errors when the tissue of interest is anisotropic. The aim of this study was to investigate changes in the measured signal strengths and the estimated positions and orientations of current dipoles in a realistically shaped torso phantom having a heart region built from single guar gum skeins. Electric data were recorded with 60 electrodes on the front of the chest and 195 sensors measured the magnetic field 2 cm above the chest. The artificial rotating dipoles were located underneath the anisotropic skeins distant from the sensors. It was found that the signal strengths and estimated dipole orientations were influenced by the anisotropy while the estimated dipole positions were not significantly influenced. The signal strength was reduced between 17% and 43% for the different dipole positions when comparing the parallel alignment of dipole orientation and anisotropy direction with the orthogonal alignment. The largest error in the estimation of dipole orientation was 42 degrees. The observed changes in the magnetic fields and electric potentials can be explained by the fact that the anisotropic skeins force the current along its direction. We conclude that taking into account anisotropic structures in the volume conductor might improve signal analysis as well as source strength and orientation estimations for bioelectric and biomagnetic investigations.

TI Estimation of Time-Varying Connectivity Patterns Through the Use of an
   Adaptive Directed Transfer Function
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB Frequency-derived identification of the propagation of information between brain regions has quickly become a popular area in the neurosciences. Of the various techniques used to study the propagation of activation within the central nervous system, the directed transfer function (DTF) has been well used to explore the functional connectivity during a variety of brain states and pathological conditions. However, the DTF method assumes the stationarity of the neural electrical signals and the time invariance of the connectivity among different channels over the investigated time window. Such assumptions may not be valid in the abnormal brain signals such as seizures and interictal spikes in epilepsy patients. In the present study, we have developed an adaptive DTF (ADTF) method through the,use of a multivariate adaptive autoregressive model to study the time-variant propagation of seizures and interictal spikes in simulated electrocorticogram (ECoG) networks. The time-variant connectivity reconstruction is achieved by the Kalman filter algorithm, which can incorporate time-varying state equations. We study the performance of the proposed method through simulations with various propagation models using either sample seizures or interictal spikes as the source waveform. The present results suggest that the new ADTF method correctly captures the temporal dynamics of the propagation models, while the DTF method cannot, and even returns erroneous results in some cases. The present ADTF method was tested in real epileptiform ECoG data from an epilepsy patient, and the ADTF results are consistent with the clinical assessments performed by neurologists.

TI Evaluation of hierarchical Bayesian method through retinotopic brain
   activities reconstruction from fMRI and MEG signals
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB A hierarchical Bayesian method estimated current sources from MEG data, incorporating an fMRI constraint as a hierarchical prior whose strength is controlled by hyperparameters. A previous study [Sato. M., Yoshioka, T., Kajihara, S., Toyama, K., Goda, N., Doya, K., Kawato, M., 2004. Hierarchical Bayesian estimation for MEG inverse problem. Neuroimage 23, 806-826] demonstrated that fMRI information improves the localization accuracy for Simulated data. The goal of the present study is to confirm the usefulness of the hierarchical Bayesian method by the real MEG and fMRI experiments using visual stimuli with a fan-shaped checkerboard pattern presented ill four visual quadrants. The proper range of hyperparameters was systematically analyzed using goodness of estimate measures for the estimated currents. The robustness with respect to false-positive activities in the fMRI information was also evaluated by using noisy priors constructed by adding artificial noises to real fMRI signals. It was shown that with appropriate hyperparameter values, the retinotopic organization and temporal dynamics in the early visual area were reconstructed, which were in a close correspondence with the known brain imaging and electrophysiology of the humans and monkeys. The false-positive effects of the noisy priors were suppressed by using appropriate hyperparameter values. The hierarchical Bayesian method also was capable of reconstructing retinotopic sequential activation in V1 with fine spatiotemporal resolution, from MEG data elicited by sequential Stimulation of the four Visual quadrants with the fan-shaped checker board pattern at much shorter intervals (150 and 400 ms) than the temporal resolution of fMRI. These results indicate the potential capability for the hierarchical Bayesian method combining MEG with fMRI to improve the spatiotemporal resolution of noninvasive brain activity measurement.

This entails a simple extension of existing source reconstiruction techniques based upon the inversion of hierarchical models.

TI Removal of the eye-blink artifacts from EEGs via STF-TS modeling and
   robust minimum variance beamforming
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB A novel scheme for the removal of eye-blink (EB) artifacts from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals based on a novel space-time-frequency (STF) model of EEGs and robust minimum variance beamformer (RMVB) is proposed. In this method, in order to remove the artifact, the RMVB is provided with a priori information, namely, an estimation of the steering vector corresponding to the point source EB artifact. The artifact-removed EEGs are subsequently reconstructed by deflation. The a priori knowledge, the vector corresponding to the spatial distribution of the EB factor, is identified using the STF model of EEGs, provided by the parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) method. In order to reduce the computational complexity present in the estimation of the STF model using the three-way PARAFAC, the time domain is subdivided into a number of segments, and a four-Way array is then set to estimate the STF-time/segment ITS) model of the data using the four-way PARAFAC. The correct number of the factors of the STF model is effectively estimated by using a novel core consistency diagnostic- (CORCONDIA-) based measure. Subsequently, the STF-TS model is shown to closely approximate the classic STF model, with significantly lower computational cost. The results confirm that the proposed algorithm effectively identifies and removes the EB artifact from raw EEG measurements.

TI Quantification of the benefit from integrating MEG and EEG data in
   minimum l(2)-norm estimation
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB Source current estimation from electromagnetic (MEG and EEG) signals is an ill-posed problem that often produces blurry or inaccurately positioned estimates. The two modalities have distinct factors limiting the resolution, e.g., MEG cannot detect radially oriented sources, while EEG is sensitive to accuracy of the head model. This makes combined EEG+MEG estimation techniques desirable, but different acquisition noise statistics, complexity of the head models, and lack of pertinent metrics all Complicate the assessment of the resulting improvements. We investigated analytically the effect of including EEG recordings in MEG studies versus the addition of new MEG channels when computing noise-normalized minimum l(2)-norm estimates. Three-compartment boundary-element forward models were constructed using structural MRI scans for four subjects. Singular value analysis of the resulting forward models predicted better performance of the EEG+MEG case in the form of higher matrix rank. MNE inverse operators for EEG, MEG and EEG + MEG were constructed using the sensor noise covariance estimated from data. Metrics derived from the resolution matrices predicted higher spatial resolution in EEG+ MEG as compared to MEG due to decreased spread (lower spatial dispersion, higher resolution index) with no reduction in dipole localization error. The effect was apparent in all source locations, with increased magnitude for deep areas such as the cingulate cortex. We were also able to corroborate the results for the somatosensory cortex using median nerve responses. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Three-dimensional brain current source reconstruction from intra-cranial
   ECoG recordings
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB We have investigated 3-dimensional brain current density reconstruction (CDR) from intracranial electrocorticogram (ECoG) recordings by means of finite element method (FEM). The brain electrical sources are modeled by a current density distribution and estimated from the ECoG signals with the aid of a weighted minimum norm estimation algorithm. A series of computer simulations were conducted to evaluate the performance of ECoG-CDR by comparing with the scalp EEG based CDR results. The present computer simulation results indicate that the ECoG-CDR provides enhanced performance in localizing single dipole sources which are located in regions underneath the implanted subdural ECoG grids, and in distinguishing and imaging multiple separate dipole sources, in comparison to the CDR results as obtained from the scalp EEG under the same conditions. We have also demonstrated the applicability of the present ECoG-CDR method to estimate 3-dimensional Current density distribution from the subdural ECoG recordings in a human epilepsy patient. Eleven interictal epilepti form spikes (seven from the frontal region and four from parietal region) in an epilepsy patient undergoing surgical evaluation were analyzed. The present promising results indicate the feasibility and applicability of the developed ECoG-CDR method of estimating brain sources from intracranial electrical recordings, with detailed forward modeling using FEM.

TI Multivariate reconstruction of functional networks from cortical sources
   dynamics in MEG/EEG
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB In this paper, we present a simple method to find networks of time-correlated brain sources, using a singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis of the source matrix estimated after any linear distributed inverse problem in magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG). Despite the high dimension of the source space, our method allows for the rapid computation of the source matrix. In order to do this, we use the linear relationship between sensors and sources, and show that the SVD can be calculated through a simple and fast computation. We show that this method allows the estimation of one or several global networks of correlated sources without calculating a coupling coefficient between all pairs of sources. A series of simulations studies were performed to estimate the efficiency of the method. In order to illustrate the validity of this approach in experimental conditions, we used real MEG data from a visual stimulation task on one test subject and estimated, in different time windows of interest, functional networks of correlated sources.

TI Brain activation during fast driving in a driving simulator: the role of
   the lateral prefrontal cortex
SO NEUROREPORT
AB Little is currently known about the neural underpinnings of the cognitive control of driving behavior in realistic situations and of the driver's speeding behavior in particular. In this study, participants drove in realistic scenarios presented in a high-end driving simulator. Scalp-recorded EEG oscillations in the a-band (8-13 Hz) with a 30-electrode montage were recorded while the participants drove under different conditions: (i) excessively fast (Fast), (ii) in a controlled manner at a safe speed (Correct), and (iii) impatiently in the context of testing traffic conditions (Impatient). Intracerebral sources of a-band activation were estimated using low resolution electrical tomography. Given that previous studies have shown a strong negative correlation between the Bold response in the frontal cortex and the a-band power, we used or-band-related activity as an estimation of frontal activation. Statistical analysis revealed more a-band-related activity (i.e. less neuronal activation) in the right lateral prefrontal cortex, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, during fast driving. Those participants who speeded most and exhibited greater risk-taking behavior demonstrated stronger a-related activity (i.e. less neuronal activation) in the left anterior lateral prefrontal cortex. These findings are discussed in the context of current theories about the role of the lateral prefrontal cortex in controlling risk-taking behavior, task switching, and multitasking.

Electrophysiological research has demonstrated the relevance to face processing of a negative deflection peaking around 170 ms, labelled accordingly as N170 in the electroencephalogram (EEG) and M170 in magnetoencephalography (MEG). The M170 was shown to be sensitive to the inversion of faces and to familiarity-two factors that are assumed to be crucial for congenital prosopagnosia. In order to locate the cognitive dysfunction and its neural correlates, we investigated the time course of neural activity in response to these manipulations.
   Methodology: Seven individuals with congenital prosopagnosia and seven matched controls participated in the experiment. To explore brain activity with high accuracy in time, we recorded evoked magnetic fields (275 channel whole head MEG) while participants were looking at faces differing in familiarity (famous vs. unknown) and orientation (upright vs. inverted). The underlying neural sources were estimated by means of the least square minimum-norm-estimation (L2-MNE) approach.
   Principal Findings: The behavioural data corroborate earlier findings on impaired configural processing in congenital prosopagnosia. For the M170, the overall results replicated earlier findings, with larger occipito-temporal brain responses to inverted than upright faces, and more right-than left-hemispheric activity. Compared to controls, participants with congenital prosopagnosia displayed a general decrease in brain activity, primarily over left occipitotemporal areas. This attenuation did not interact with familiarity or orientation.
   Conclusions: The study substantiates the finding of an early involvement of the left hemisphere in symptoms of prosopagnosia. This might be related to an efficient and overused featural processing strategy which serves as a compensation of impaired configural processing.

TI A data-driven model of the generation of human EEG based on a spatially
   distributed stochastic wave equation
SO COGNITIVE NEURODYNAMICS
AB We discuss a model for the dynamics of the primary current density vector field within the grey matter of human brain. The model is based on a linear damped wave equation, driven by a stochastic term. By employing a realistically shaped average brain model and an estimate of the matrix which maps the primary currents distributed over grey matter to the electric potentials at the surface of the head, the model can be put into relation with recordings of the electroencephalogram (EEG). Through this step it becomes possible to employ EEG recordings for the purpose of estimating the primary current density vector field, i.e. finding a solution of the inverse problem of EEG generation. As a technique for inferring the unobserved high-dimensional primary current density field from EEG data of much lower dimension, a linear state space modelling approach is suggested, based on a generalisation of Kalman filtering, in combination with maximum-likelihood parameter estimation. The resulting algorithm for estimating dynamical solutions of the EEG inverse problem is applied to the task of localising the source of an epileptic spike from a clinical EEG data set; for comparison, we apply to the same task also a non-dynamical standard algorithm.

TI Dynamic causal modelling for EEG and MEG
SO COGNITIVE NEURODYNAMICS
AB Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) is an approach first introduced for the analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to quantify effective connectivity between brain areas. Recently, this framework has been extended and established in the magneto/encephalography (M/EEG) domain. DCM for M/EEG entails the inversion a full spatiotemporal model of evoked responses, over multiple conditions. This model rests on a biophysical and neurobiological generative model for electrophysiological data. A generative model is a prescription of how data are generated. The inversion of a DCM provides conditional densities on the model parameters and, indeed on the model itself. These densities enable one to answer key questions about the underlying system. A DCM comprises two parts; one part describes the dynamics within and among neuronal sources, and the second describes how source dynamics generate data in the sensors, using the lead-field. The parameters of this spatiotemporal model are estimated using a single (iterative) Bayesian procedure. In this paper, we will motivate and describe the current DCM framework. Two examples show how the approach can be applied to M/EEG experiments.

TI The path to success in auditory spatial discrimination: Electrical
   neuroimaging responses within the supratemporal plane predict
   performance outcome
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB Auditory scene analysis requires the accurate encoding and comparison of the perceived spatial positions of sound sources. The electrophysiological correlates of auditory spatial discrimination and their relationship to performance accuracy were studied in humans by applying electrical neuroimaging analyses to auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) that were recorded during the completion of a near-threshold S1-S2 paradigm within the right hemispace. Data were sorted as a function of performance accuracy, and AEP responses 75-117 ms after the presentation of the first sound differed topographically between trials leading to correct and incorrect spatial discrimination. Distributed source estimations revealed that this followed from significantly stronger activity within the left (i.e. contralateral) supratemporal plane (STP) and the left inferior parietal lobule prior to correct versus incorrect discrimination performance. Successful spatial discrimination thus depends on the activity of distinct configurations of active brain networks within the contralateral temporo-parietal cortex over a time period when the first sound position is being encoded. Furthermore, significant positive correlations were observed between performance accuracy and the intracranial activity estimated within the left STP. The efficacy of S1 processing within the STP is thus predictive of behavioral performance outcome during auditory spatial discrimination. Our data support a model wherein refinement of spatial representations occurs within the STP and that interactions with parietal structures allow for transformations into coordinate frames that are required for higher-order computations including absolute localization of sound sources.

TI Dipole estimation errors due to differences in modeling anisotropic
   conductivities in realistic head models for EEG source analysis
SO PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
AB To improve the EEG source localization in the brain, the conductivities used in the head model play a very important role. In this study, we focus on the modeling of the anisotropic conductivity of the white matter. The anisotropic conductivity profile can be derived from diffusion weighted magnetic resonance images (DW-MRI). However, deriving these anisotropic conductivities from diffusion weighted MR images of the white matter is not straightforward. In the literature, two methods can be found for calculating the conductivity from the diffusion weighted images. One method uses a fixed value for the ratio of the conductivity in different directions, while the other method uses a conductivity profile obtained from a linear scaling of the diffusion ellipsoid. We propose a model which can be used to derive the conductivity profile from the diffusion tensor images. This model is based on the variable anisotropic ratio throughout the white matter and is a combination of the linear relationship as stated in the literature, with a constraint on the magnitude of the conductivity tensor ( also known as the volume constraint). This approach is stated in the paper as approach A. In our study we want to investigate dipole estimation differences due to using a more simplified model for white matter anisotropy ( approach B), while the electrode potentials are derived using a head model with a more realistic approach for the white matter anisotropy ( approach A). We used a realistic head model, in which the forward problem was solved using a finite difference method that can incorporate anisotropic conductivities. As error measures we considered the dipole location error and the dipole orientation error. The results show that the dipole location errors are all below 10 mm and have an average of 4 mm in gray matter regions. The dipole orientation errors ranged up to 66.4 degrees, and had a mean of, on average, 11.6 degrees in gray matter regions. In a qualitative manner, the results show that the orientation and location error is dependent on the orientation of the test dipole. The location error is larger when the orientation of the test dipole is similar to the orientation of the anisotropy, while the orientation error is larger when the orientation of the test dipole deviates from the orientation of the anisotropy. From these results, we can conclude that the modeling of white matter anisotropy plays an important role in EEG source localization. More specifically, accurate source localization will require an accurate modeling of the white matter conductivity profile in each voxel.

TI Human brain mapping: Hemodynamic response and electrophysiology
SO CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
CT 28th International Congress of Clinical Neurophysiology
CY SEP 10-14, 2006
CL Edinburgh, SCOTLAND
AB In view of the recent advance in functional neuroimaging, the current status of non-invasive techniques applied for human brain mapping was reviewed by integrating two principles: hemodynamic and electrophysiological, from the viewpoint of clinical neurophysiology. The currently available functional neuroimaging techniques based on hemodynamic principles are functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Electrophysiological techniques include electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). As for the coupling between hemodynamic response and neuronal activity (neurovascular coupling), experimental studies suggest that the hemodynamic response is significantly correlated to neuronal activity, especially local field potential (synaptic activity) rather than spiking activity, within a certain range. The hemodynamic response tends to be more widespread in space and lasts longer in time as compared with the neuronal activity. Since each technique has its own characteristic features especially in terms of spatial and temporal resolution, it is important to adopt the most appropriate technique for solving each specific question, and it is useful to combine two techniques either simultaneously or in separate sessions. As for the multi-modal approach, the combined use of EEG and MEG, EEG and PET, or EEG and fMRI is applied for the simultaneous studies, and for the separate use of two different techniques, the information obtained from fMRI is used for estimating the generator source from EEG or MEG data (fMRI-con strained source estimation). Functional connectivity among different brain areas can be studied by using a single technique such as the EEG coherence or the correlation analysis of fMRI or PET data, or by combining the stimulation technique such as TMS with neuroimaging. Further advance of each technology and improvement in the analysis method will promote the understanding of precise functional specialization and inter-areal coupling, and will contribute to the increased efficacy of rapidly developing physiological treatments of neurological and psychiatric disorders.

TI A site-related suitability analysis for the production of biomass as a
   contribution to sustainable regional land-use
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB The use of renewable energy in Europe offers the possibility of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and contributes to energy security and independence. With the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and a variety of recently introduced national directives supporting renewable energy sources in the European Union, the economic attractiveness of bioenergy production has distinctly increased. This article combines an economic evaluation of biomass production with site-related natural conditions of the Havelland region, situated in the north-east area of Germany. Two methods for evaluating site-specific potential biomass yields were compared. For three example biomass crops, evaluations of yield estimations at agricultural lots for site-optimized suitability (SOS) and conventional suitability (CS) were carried out. Both modelling approaches were compared. The results of the GIS modelling indicate that the financial support for increasing the use of renewable energy with the German feed-in system, called Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz (EEG), will possibly lead to an increased cultivation of crops with high biomass output. This monocultural orientation of farming practices and the negative effects on the ecosystem could act in opposition to other environmental initiatives of the EU. The outputs of the SOS analysis show that high biomass production could be integrated into environmental policy proposals. Therefore, new EU policy should take modified subsidies into consideration in order to avoid developing conflicts between small-scale changes in landscape ecosystems caused by large-scale transformations in energy policy.

TI Correlation between signal-to-noise ratios and region of interest
   sensitivity ratios of bipolar EEG measurements
SO MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING
AB We have developed a parameter, which describes how well the measurement is concentrated on the region of interest source area compared to other source areas in the volume conductor. The parameter concept is called the region of interest sensitivity ratio (ROISR). We assume that ROISR is also connected to the SNR of the measurement. The objective of the present study was to investigate the assumed correlation between the ROISR and SNR of the measurement with three-layer spherical head model. We studied how the source distribution and orientation affect the correlation and thus how applicable the ROISR is in analysing the sensitivity distributions of measurements. We simulated bipolar EEG-evoked potential measurements with 16 combinations of four-source distribution and four-source orientation models. The results indicate that the ROISR correlates with the SNR of the measurement with all tested source distributions and orientations. Thus the ROISRs concept can be applied to analyse measurement setups by modelling and analysing the sensitivity distributions.

TI An automatic procedure for the analysis of electric and magnetic
   mismatch negativity based on anatomical brain mapping
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS
AB Data processing techniques in electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) need user interactions. However, particularly in clinical applications, fast and objective data processing is important. Here we present an observer-independent method for EEG and MEG analysis of mismatch negativity (MMN) that allows reliable estimation of source activity based on objective anatomical references. The procedure integrates several steps including artifact rejection, source estimation and statistical analysis. It enables the evaluation of source activity in a fully automatic and unsupervised manner. To test its feasibility we obtained EEG and MEG responses in an auditory oddball paradigm in 12 healthy volunteers. The automatized method of EEG and MEG data analysis estimated source activity. The automatically detected MMN was closely comparable with the results obtained by a user-controlled method based on the dipole fitting. The presented workflow can be performed easily, rapidly, and reliably. This development may open new fields in research and clinical applications of source-based EEG and MEG. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

TI Array response kernels for EEG and MEG in multilayer ellipsoidal
   geometry
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB We present forward modeling solutions in the form of array response kernels for electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), assuming that a multilayer ellipsoidal geometry approximates the anatomy of the head and a dipole current models the source. The use of an ellipsoidal geometry is useful in cases for which incorporating the anisotropy of the head is important but a better model cannot be defined. The structure of our forward solutions facilitates the analysis of the inverse problem by factoring the lead field into a product of the current dipole source and a kernel containing the information corresponding to the head geometry and location of the source and sensors. This factorization allows the inverse problem to be approached as an explicit function of just the location parameters, which reduces the complexity of the estimation solution search. Our forward solutions have the potential of facilitating the solution of the inverse problem, as they provide algebraic representations suitable for numerical implementation. The applicability of our models is illustrated with numerical examples on real EEG/MEG data of N20 responses. Our results show that the residual data after modeling the N20 response using a dipole for the source and an ellipsoidal geometry for the head is in average lower than the residual remaining when a spherical geometry is used for the same estimated dipole.

TI A novel method for automated classification of epileptiform activity in
   the human electroencephalogram-based on independent component analysis
SO MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING
AB Diagnosis of several neurological disorders is based on the detection of typical pathological patterns in the electroencephalogram (EEG). This is a time-consuming task requiring significant training and experience. Automatic detection of these EEG patterns would greatly assist in quantitative analysis and interpretation. We present a method, which allows automatic detection of epileptiform events and discrimination of them from eye blinks, and is based on features derived using a novel application of independent component analysis. The algorithm was trained and cross validated using seven EEGs with epileptiform activity. For epileptiform events with compensation for eyeblinks, the sensitivity was 65 +/- 22% at a specificity of 86 +/- 7% (mean +/- SD). With feature extraction by PCA or classification of raw data, specificity reduced to 76 and 74%, respectively, for the same sensitivity. On exactly the same data, the commercially available software Reveal had a maximum sensitivity of 30% and concurrent specificity of 77%. Our algorithm performed well at detecting epileptiform events in this preliminary test and offers a flexible tool that is intended to be generalized to the simultaneous classification of many waveforms in the EEG.

TI New method for analysing sensitivity distributions of
   electroencephalography measurements
SO MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING
AB In this paper, we introduce a new modelling related parameter called region of interest sensitivity ratio (ROISR), which describes how well the sensitivity of an electroencephalography (EEG) measurement is concentrated within the region of interest (ROI), i.e. how specific the measurement is to the sources in ROI. We demonstrate the use of the concept by analysing the sensitivity distributions of bipolar EEG measurement. We studied the effects of interelectrode distance of a bipolar EEG lead on the ROISR with cortical and non-cortical ROIs. The sensitivity distributions of EEG leads were calculated analytically by applying a three-layer spherical head model. We suggest that the developed parameter has correlation to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a measurement, and thus we studied the correlation between ROISR and SNR with 254-channel visual evoked potential (VEP) measurements of two testees. Theoretical simulations indicate that source orientation and location have major impact on the specificity and therefore they should be taken into account when the optimal bipolar electrode configuration is selected. The results also imply that the new ROISR method bears a strong correlation to the SNR of measurement and can thus be applied in the future studies to efficiently evaluate and optimize EEG measurement setups.

TI Multichannel recording of median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials
SO NEUROPHYSIOLOGIE CLINIQUE-CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB Objectives. -Clinical applications of multichannel (>= 64 electrodes) electroencephalography (EEG) have been limited so far. Amplitude variability of evoked potentials in healthy subjects is large, which limits their diagnostic applicability. This amplitude variability may be partially due to spatial undersampling of anatomical variations in cortical generators. In the present study, we therefore investigated whether 128-channel recordings of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) can reduce this amplitude variability in healthy subjects. Additionally, we explored the relation between amplitude and age.
   Methods. -We recorded median nerve SEPs using a 128-channel EEG system in 50 healthy subjects (20-70 years) and compared N20, P27, and P45 amplitude as obtained with a 128-channel analysis method - based on butterfly plots and spatial topographies - and as obtained using a conventional one-cortical-channel configuration and analysis. Scalp and earlobe references were compared.
   Results. -Although amplitude variability itself was not reduced, a reduced coefficient of variation was obtained with the 128-channel method due to higher SEP amplitudes, compared to the conventional one-channel. method, independent of reference.
   Conclusion. -These results suggest that at the cost of some additional preparation time, the 128-channel method can measure SEP amplitude more accurately and might therefore be more sensitive to physiological and pathological changes.
   For optimal amplitude estimation, we recommend to increase the number of centroparietal electrodes or, preferably, to perform at least a 64-channel recording. (C) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Our working hypothesis predicted that, since HREEG pre-processing removes spatial correlation introduced by current conduction in the head structures, by providing the BCI with waveforms that are mostly due to the unmixed activity of a small cortical region, a more reliable classification would be obtained, at least when the activity to detect has a limited generator, which is the case in motor related tasks. HREEG techniques employed in this study rely on (i) individual head models derived from anatomical magnetic resonance images, (ii) distributed source model, composed of a layer of current dipoles, geometrically constrained to the cortical mantle, (iii) depth-weighted minimum L-2-norm constraint and Tikhonov regularization for linear inverse problem solution and (iv) estimation of electrical activity in cortical regions of interest corresponding to relevant Brodmann areas. Six subjects were trained to learn self modulation of sensorimotor EEG rhythms, related to the imagination of limb movements. Off-line EEG data was used to estimate waveforms of cortical activity (cortical current density, CCD) on selected regions of interest. CCD waveforms were fed into the BCI computational pipeline as an alternative to raw EEG signals; spectral features are evaluated through statistical tests (r(2) analysis), to quantify their reliability for BCI control. These results are compared, within subjects, to analogous results obtained without HREEG techniques. The processing procedure was designed in such a way that computations could be split into a setup phase (which includes most of the computational burden) and the actual EEG processing phase, which was limited to a single matrix multiplication. This separation allowed to make the procedure suitable for on-line utilization, and a pilot experiment was performed. Results show that lateralization of electrical activity, which is expected to be contralateral to the imagined movement, is more evident on the estimated CCDs than in the scalp potentials. CCDs produce a pattern of relevant spectral features that is more spatially focused, and has a higher statistical significance (EEG: 0.20 +/- 0.114 S.D.; CCD: 0.55 +/- 0. 16 S.D.; p = 10(-5)). A pilot experiment showed that a trained subject could utilize voluntary modulation of estimated CCDs for accurate (eight targets) on-line control of a cursor. This study showed that it is practically feasible to utilize HREEG techniques for on-line operation of a BCI system; off-line analysis suggests that accuracy of BCI control is enhanced by the proposed method.

TI Concordance between distributed EEG source localization and simultaneous
   EEG-fMRI studies of epileptic spikes
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB In order to analyze where epileptic spikes are generated, we assessed the level of concordance between EEG source localization using distributed source models and simultaneous EEG-fMRI which measures the hemodynamic correlates of EEG activity. Data to be compared were first estimated on the same cortical surface and two comparison strategies were used: (1) MEM-concordance: a comparison between EEG sources localized with the Maximum Entropy on the Mean (MEM) method and fMRI clusters showing a significant hemodynamic response. Minimal geodesic distances between local extrema and overlap measurements between spatial extents of EEG sources and fMRI clusters were used to quantify MEM-concordance. (2) fMRI-relevance: estimation of the fMRI-relevance index a quantifying if sources located in an fMRI cluster could explain some scalp EEG data, when this fMRI cluster was used to constrain the EEG inverse problem. Combining MEM-concordance and fMRI-relevance (alpha) indexes, each fMRI cluster showing a significant hemodynamic response (p<0.05 corrected) was classified according to its concordance with EEG data. Nine patients with focal epilepsy who underwent EEG-fMRI examination followed by EEG recording outside the scanner were selected for this study. Among the 62 fMRI clusters analyzed (7 patients), 15 (24%) found in 6 patients were highly concordant with EEG according to both MEM-concordance and fMRI-relevance. EEG concordance was found for 5 clusters (8%) according to et only, suggesting sources missed by the MEM. No concordance with EEG was found for 30 clusters (48%) and for 10 clusters (16%) alpha was significantly negative, suggesting EEG-fMRI discordance. We proposed two complementary strategies to assess and classifv EEG-fMRI concordance. We showed that for most patients, part of the hemodynamic response to spikes was highly concordant with EEG sources, whereas other fMRI clusters in response to the same spikes were found distant or discordant with EEG sources.

TI A novel semiblind signal extraction approach for the removal of
   eye-blink artifact from EEGs
SO EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING
AB A novel blind signal extraction (BSE) scheme for the removal of eye-blink artifact from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is proposed. In this method, in order to remove the artifact, the source extraction algorithm is provided with an estimation of the column of the mixing matrix corresponding to the point source eye-blink artifact. The eye-blink source is first extracted and then cleaned, artifact-removed EEGs are subsequently reconstructed by a deflation method. The a priori knowledge, namely, the vector, corresponding to the spatial distribution of the eye-blink factor, is identified by fitting a space-time-frequency (STF) model to the EEG measurements using the parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis method. Hence, we call the BSE approach semiblind signal extraction (SBSE). This approach introduces the possibility of incorporating PARAFAC within the blind source extraction framework for single trial EEG processing applications and the respected formulations. Moreover, aiming at extracting the eye-blink artifact, it exploits the spatial as well as temporal prior information during the extraction procedure. Experiments on synthetic data and real EEG measurements confirm that the proposed algorithm effectively identifies and removes the eye-blink artifact from raw EEG measurements.

TI Exploration of computational methods for classification of movement
   intention during human voluntary movement from single trial EEG
SO CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB Objective: To explore effective combinations of computational methods for the prediction of movement intention preceding the production of self-paced right and left hand movements from single trial scalp electroencephalogram (EEG).
   Methods: Twelve naive subjects performed self-paced movements consisting of three key strokes with either hand. EEG was recorded from 128 channels. The exploration was performed offline on single trial EEG data. We proposed that a successful computational procedure for classification would consist of spatial filtering, temporal filtering, feature selection, and pattern classification. A systematic investigation was performed with combinations of spatial filtering using principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), common spatial patterns analysis (CSP), and surface Laplacian derivation (SLD); temporal filtering using power spectral density estimation (PSD) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT); pattern classification using linear Mahalanobis distance classifier (LMD), quadratic Mahalanobis distance classifier (QMD), Bayesian classifier (BSC), multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP), probabilistic neural network (PNN), and support vector machine (SVM). A robust multivariate feature selection strategy using a genetic algorithm was employed.
   Results: The combinations of spatial filtering using ICA and SLD, temporal filtering using PSD and DWT, and classification methods using LMD, QMD, BSC and SVM provided higher performance than those of other combinations. Utilizing one of the better combinations of ICA, PSD and SVM, the discrimination accuracy was as high as 75%. Further feature analysis showed that beta band EEG activity of the channels over right sensorimotor cortex was most appropriate for discrimination of right and left hand movement intention.
   Conclusions: Effective combinations of computational methods provide possible classification of human movement intention from single trial EEG. Such a method could be the basis for a potential brain-computer interface based on human natural movement, which might reduce the requirement of long-term training.
   Significance: Effective combinations of computational methods can classify human movement intention from single trial EEG with reasonable accuracy. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI ICA model order estimation using clustering method
SO RADIOENGINEERING
AB In this paper a novel approach for independent component analysis (ICA) model order estimation of movement electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is described. The application is targeted to the brain-computer interface (BCI) EEG preprocessing. The previous work has shown that it is possible to decompose EEG into movement-related and non-movement-related independent components (ICs). The selection of only movement related ICs might lead to BCI EEG classification score increasing. The real number of the independent sources in the brain is an important parameter of the preprocessing step. Previously, we used principal component analysis (PCA) for estimation of the number of the independent sources. However, PCA estimates only the number of uncorrelated and not independent components ignoring the higher-order signal statistics. In this work, we use another approach-selection of highly correlated ICs from several ICA runs. The ICA model order estimation is done at significance level alpha = 0.05 and the model order is less or more dependent on ICA algorithm and its parameters.

TI Population-level inferences for distributed MEG source localization
   under multiple constraints: Application to face-evoked fields
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB We address some key issues entailed by population inference about responses evoked in distributed brain systems using magnetoencephalography (MEG). In particular, we look at model selection issues at the within-subject level and feature selection issues at the between-subject level, using responses evoked by intact and scrambled faces around 170 ms (M170). We compared the face validity of subject-specific forward models and their summary statistics in terms of how estimated responses reproduced over subjects. At the within-subject level, we focused on the use of multiple constraints, or priors, for inverting distributed source models. We used restricted maximum likelihood (ReML) estimates of prior covariance components (in both sensor and source space) and show that their relative importance is conserved over subjects. At the between-subject level, we used standard anatomical normalization methods to create posterior probability maps that furnish inference about regionally specific population responses. We used these to compare different summary statistics, namely; (i) whether to test for differences between condition-specific source estimates, or whether to test the source estimate of differences between conditions, and (ii) whether to accommodate differences in source orientation by using signed or unsigned (absolute) estimates of source activity.

TI Multiresolution imaging of MEG cortical sources using an explicit
   piecewise model
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB Imaging neural generators from MEG magnetic fields is often considered as a compromise between computationally-reasonable methodology that usually yields poor spatial resolution on the one hand, and more sophisticated approaches on the other hand, potentially leading to intractable computational costs.
   We approach the problem of obtaining well-resolved source images with unexcessive computation load with a multiresolution image model selection (MiMS) technique. The building blocks of the MiMS source model are parcels of the cortical surface which can be designed at multiple spatial resolutions with the combination of anatomical and functional priors. Computation charge is reduced owing to 1) compact parametric models of the activation of extended brain parcels using current multipole expansions and 2) the optimization of the generalized cross-validation error on image models, which is closed-form for the broad class of linear estimators of neural currents. Model selection can be complemented by any conventional imaging approach of neural currents restricted to the optimal image support obtained from MiMS.
   The estimation of the location and spatial extent of brain activations is discussed and evaluated using extensive Monte-Carlo simulations. An experimental evaluation was conducted with MEG data, from a somatotopic paradigm. Results show that MiMS is an efficient image model selection technique with robust performances at realistic noise levels. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Imaging functional brain connectivity patterns from high-resolution EEG
   and fMRI via graph theory
SO PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY
AB We describe a set of computational tools able to estimate cortical activity and connectivity from high- resolution EEG and fMRI recordings in humans. These methods comprise the estimation of cortical activity using realistic geometry head volume conductor models and distributed cortical source models, followed by the evaluation of cortical connectivity between regions of interest coincident with the Brodmann areas via the use of Partial Directed Coherence. Connectivity patterns estimated on the cortical surface in different frequency bands are then imaged and interpreted with measures based on graph theory. These computational tools were applied on a set of EEG and fMRI data from a Stroop task to demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach. The present findings suggest that the methodology is able to identify differences in functional connectivity patterns elicited by different experimental tasks or conditions.

TI MEG source estimation from mesio-basal temporal areas in a child with a
   porencephalic cyst
SO ACTA NEUROLOGICA SCANDINAVICA
AB Background - A child whose left temporal lobe contained mesial, anterior and basal structures but lacked superio-lateral cortex had intractable epilepsy secondary to a porencephalic cyst. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) shows equivalent current dipoles (ECDs) as dipole modeling for temporal lobe epilepsy rather than in an exact location. Aim - We hypothesized that the magnetic fields generated by the epileptic discharges in mesio-basal temporal areas could be detected by MEG without interference from the superio-lateral temporal cortices. Methods - We analyzed MEG spikes using single dipole analysis and synthetic aperture magnetometry (SAM), and compared with EEG spike topography. Results - Two MEG ECDs corresponding to T3 spikes localized to the anterior mesio-basal temporal region with vertical orientation. Sixteen MEG ECDs corresponding to T5 spikes localized to the middle to posterior mesio-basal temporal region with vertical orientation. SAM revealed maximum current density at hippocampus and anterior fusiform gyrus for T3 spikes, and at posterior hippocampus and fusiform gyrus for T5 spikes. Conclusion - Vertically oriented ECDs were obtained without superio-lateral temporal cortices because of temporo-parieto-occipital porencephalic cyst. The absence of superio-lateral temporal cortices, prominent temporal EEG spikes, less prominent MEG spikes, and mesio-basal SAM spikes indicated that the vertically oriented ECDs were projected directly from the mesio-basal temporal region.

TI Probabilistic forward model for electroencephalography source analysis
SO PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
AB Source localization by electroencephalography (EEG) requires an accurate model of head geometry and tissue conductivity. The estimation of source time courses from EEG or from EEG in conjunction with magnetoencephalography (MEG) requires a forward model consistent with true activity for the best outcome. Although MRI provides an excellent description of soft tissue anatomy, a high resolution model of the skull (the dominant resistive component of the head) requires CT, which is not justified for routine physiological studies. Although a number of techniques have been employed to estimate tissue conductivity, no present techniques provide the noninvasive 3D tomographic mapping of conductivity that would be desirable. We introduce a formalism for probabilistic forward modeling that allows the propagation of uncertainties in model parameters into possible errors in source localization. We consider uncertainties in the conductivity profile of the skull, but the approach is general and can be extended to other kinds of uncertainties in the forward model. We and others have previously suggested the possibility of extracting conductivity of the skull from measured electroencephalography data by simultaneously optimizing over dipole parameters and the conductivity values required by the forward model. Using Cramer-Rao bounds, we demonstrate that this approach does not improve localization results nor does it produce reliable conductivity estimates. We conclude that the conductivity of the skull has to be either accurately measured by an independent technique, or that the uncertainties in the conductivity values should be reflected in uncertainty in the source location estimates.

TI Canonical decomposition of ictal scalp EEG reliably detects the seizure
   onset zone
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB Long-term electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings are important in the presurgical evaluation of refractory partial epilepsy for the delineation of the irritative and ictal onset zones. in this paper we introduce a new algorithm for an automatic, fast and objective localizing of the ictal onset zone in ictal EEG recordings. We extracted the potential distribution of the ictal activity from EEG using the higher order canonical decomposition method, also referred to as the CP model. The CP model decomposes in a unique way a higher order tensor in a minimal sum of rank-I 'atoms'. We showed that only one atom is related to the seizure activity. Simulation experiments demonstrated that the method correctly extracted the potential distribution of the ictal activity even with low signal-to-noise ratios. In 37 ictal EEGs, the CP method correctly localized the seizure onset zone in 34 (92%) and visual assessment in 21 cases (57%) (p=0.00024). The CP method is a fast method to delineate the ictal onset zone in ictal EEGs and is more sensitive than visual interpretation of the ictal EEGs. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI A probabilistic algorithm integrating source localization and noise
   suppression for MEG and EEG data
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB We have developed a novel probabilistic model that estimates neural source activity measured by MEG and EEG data while suppressing the effect of interference and noise sources. The model estimates contributions to sensor data from evoked sources, interference sources and sensor noise using Bayesian methods and by exploiting knowledge about their timing and spatial covariance properties. Full posterior distributions are computed rather than just the MAP estimates. In simulation, the algorithm can accurately localize and estimate the time courses of several simultaneously active dipoles, with rotating or fixed orientation, at noise levels typical for averaged MEG data. The algorithm even performs reasonably at noise levels typical of an average of just a few trials. The algorithm is superior to beamforming techniques, which we show to be an approximation to our graphical model, in estimation of temporally correlated sources. Success of this algorithm using MEG data for localizing bilateral auditory cortex, low-SNR somatosensory activations, and for localizing an epileptic spike source are also demonstrated.

TI The advantage of combining MEG and EEG: Comparison to fMRI in focally
   stimulated visual cortex
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB To exploit the high (millisecond) temporal resolution of magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) for measuring neuronal dynamics within well-defined brain regions, it is important to quantitatively assess their localizing ability. Previous modeling studies and empirical data suggest that a combination of MEG and EEG signals should yield the most accurate localization, due to their complementary sensitivities. However, these two modalities have rarely, been explicitly combined for source estimation in studies of recorded brain activity, and a quantitative empirical assessment of their abilities, combined and separate, is currently lacking. Here we studied early visual responses to focal Gabor patches flashed during subject fixation. MEG and EEG data were collected simultaneously and were compared with the functional MRI (fMRI) localization produced by identical stimuli in the same subjects. This allowed direct evaluation of the localization accuracy of separate and combined MEG/EEG inverse solutions. We found that the localization accuracy of the combined MEG + EEG solution was consistently better than that of either modality alone, using three different source estimation approaches. Further analysis suggests that this improved localization is due to the different properties of the two imaging modalities rather than simply due to increased total channel number. Thus, combining MEG and EEG data is important for high-resolution spatiotemporal studies of the human brain. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI Improving auditory steady-state response detection using independent

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB Over the last decade, the detection of auditory steady-state responses (ASSR) has been developed for reliable hearing threshold estimation at audiometric frequencies. Unfortunately, the duration of ASSR measurement can be long, which is unpractical for wide scale clinical application. In this paper, we propose independent component analysis (ICA) as a tool to improve the ASSR detection in recorded single-channel as well as multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) data. We conclude that ICA is able to reduce measurement duration significantly. For a multichannel implementation, near-optimal performance is obtained with five-channel recordings.

TI Classification of motor imagery by means of cortical current density
   estimation and Von Neumann entropy
SO JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING
AB The goal of the present study is to employ the source imaging methods such as cortical current density estimation for the classification of left- and right-hand motor imagery tasks, which may be used for brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. The scalp recorded EEG was first preprocessed by surface Laplacian filtering, time-frequency filtering, noise normalization and independent component analysis. Then the cortical imaging technique was used to solve the EEG inverse problem. Cortical current density distributions of left and right trials were classified from each other by exploiting the concept of Von Neumann entropy. The proposed method was tested on three human subjects (180 trials each) and a maximum accuracy of 91.5% and an average accuracy of 88% were obtained. The present results confirm the hypothesis that source analysis methods may improve accuracy for classification of motor imagery tasks. The present promising results using source analysis for classification of motor imagery enhances our ability of performing source analysis from single trial EEG data recorded on the scalp, and may have applications to improved BCI systems.

TI Annotation: What electrical brain activity tells us about brain function
   that other techniques cannot tell us - a child psychiatric perspective
SO JOURNAL OF CHILD PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY
AB Background: Monitoring brain processes in real time requires genuine subsecond resolution to follow the typical timing and frequency of neural events. Non-invasive recordings of electric (EEG/ERP) and magnetic (MEG) fields provide this time resolution. They directly measure neural activations associated with a wide variety of brain states and processes, even during sleep or in infants. Mapping and source estimation can localise these time-varying activation patterns inside the brain. Methods: Recent EEG/ERP research on brain functions in the domains of attention and executive functioning, perception, memory, language, emotion and motor processing in ADHD, autism, childhood-onset schizophrenia, Tourette syndrome, specific language disorder and developmental dyslexia, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and depression is reviewed. Results: Over the past two decades, electrophysiology has substantially contributed to the understanding of brain functions during normal development, and psychiatric conditions of children and adolescents. Its time resolution has been important to measure covert processes, and to distinguish cause and effect. Conclusions: In the future, EEG/ERP parameters will increasingly characterise the interplay of neural states and information processing. They are particularly promising tools for multilevel investigations of etiological pathways and potential predictors of clinical treatment response.

AB This paper describes a proposal for a new source space model called the multilevel source space model for the efficient and precise estimation of brain electrical activities. Unlike conventional source models, the proposed one generates both high- and low-resolution brain models which represent gray matter of a human cerebral cortex. The model can then be used to estimate brain electrical sources in a multiresolutive way. The usefulness of the proposed model has been verified using realistic simulations with real brain noise and anatomy.

AB This paper is a report of an investigation of the relationship between the condition number of a leadfield matrix of magnetoencephalography and source reconstruction accuracy. We suggest the use of the condition number as a promising a priori accuracy estimator of a neuromagnetic inverse problem (NIP) since various simulation studies demonstrated that the reconstructed source distribution has the wider region and contains more spurious sources if a leadfield matrix has the higher condition number. The simulation results also verified that the accuracy estimator based upon the condition number can explain well-known phenomena of NIP, which suggests a potential application of the proposed concept.

In the proposed approach, only four free parameters need to be evaluated for each anatomically constrained area source to express both spatial locations and extensions of brain electrical activities on cortical surface. The feasibility of the proposed model is verified through the applications to realistic EEG simulations and epilepsy patient's data.

SP Ctr Integrat Neurosci & Neuroengn Res
AB There is increasing interest in mapping and source reconstruction from electrocorticoencephalographic (ECoG) grid data and comparison to surface EEG evaluations of epileptic patients. ECoG mapping onto three-dimensional renderings of the individual cortical anatomy derived from magnetic resonance images and computed tomography (CT) is pet-formed after coregistration of anatomical and functional coordinate systems. Source reconstructions from ECoG and EEG are compared using different source models and realistically shaped volume conductor models. Realistically shaped volume conductor models for EEG source reconstruction are a prerequisite for improved localization accuracy. Individual boundary element method (BEM) models derived from MRI represent the "gold standard" and can approximate isotropic homogeneous head compartments and thus give an improved description of the head shape as compared with classical oversimplifying spherical shell models. Anisotropic volume conduction properties of the bone layer or the white matter fibers can be described by the finite element method (FEM); unfortunately, these models require a huge computational effort and are thus not used in daily applications. To avoid this computational effort, head models derived from an averaged MRI dataset can be used. Highly refined models with a large number of nodes and thus better numerical accuracy can be used by this approach, because the setup is performed only once and the decomposed models or precomputed leadfield matrices are saved for later application. Individual image data are not at all needed, if an overlay of the reconstruction results with the anatomy is not desired. With precomputed leadfield matrices and linear interpolation techniques, at least standardized BEM and FEM volume conductor models derived from averaged MRI datasets can achieve the same computational speed as analytical spherical models. The smoothed cortical envelope is used as a realistically shaped single-shell volume conductor model for ECoG source reconstruction, whereas three-compartment BEM-models are required for EEG. The authors describe how to localize ECoG-grid electrode positions and how to segment the cortical surface from coregistered magnetic resonance and CT images. Landmark-based coregistration is performed using common fiducials in both image modalities. Another more promising automatic approach is based on mutual three-dimensional volume graylevel information. The ECoG electrode positions can be retrieved from three-dimensional CT slices manually using cursors in thresholded images with depth information. Alternatively, the smoothed envelope of the cortical surface segmented from the MRI is used to semiautomatically determine the grid electrode positions by marking the four corners and measuring distances along the smoothed surface. With extended source patches for cortically constrained scans and current density reconstructions, results from ECoG and surface EEG data were compared. Single equivalent dipoles were used to explain the EEG far fields, and results were compared with the original current density distributions explaining the ECoG data. The authors studied the performance of spherical and realistically shaped BEM volume conductor models for EEG and ECoG source reconstruction in spherical and nonspherical parts of the head with simulations and measured epileptic spike data.
   Only small differences between spherical and realistically shaped models were found in the spherical parts of the head, whereas realistically shaped models are superior to spherical approximtions in both single-shell ECoG and three-shell EEG cases in the nonspherical parts, such as the temporal lobe areas. The ECoG near field is more complicated to interpret than the surface EEG far field and cannot be explained in general by simple equivalent dipoles. However, from simulations with realistically shaped volume conductor models and cortically constrained source models, the authors studied how the bone and skin layer act as spatial low pass filters that smooth and simplify the surface EEG maps generated by much more complicated-looking source configurations derived from measured ECoG data.

TI Hierarchical Bayesian estimates of distributed MEG sources: Theoretical
   aspects and comparison of variational and MCMC methods
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB Magnetoencephalography (MEG) provides millisecond-scale temporal resolution for noninvasive mapping of human brain functions, but the problem of reconstructing the underlying source currents from the extracranial data has no unique solution. Several distributed source estimation methods based on different prior assumptions have been suggested for the resolution of this inverse problem. Recently, a hierarchical Bayesian generalization of the traditional minimum norm estimate (NINE) was proposed, in which the variance of distributed current at each cortical location is considered as a random variable and estimated from the data using the variational Bayesian (VB) framework. Here, we introduce an alternative scheme for performing Bayesian inference in the context of this hierarchical model by using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) strategies. In principle, the MCMC method is capable of numerically representing the true posterior distribution of the currents whereas the VB approach is inherently approximative. We point out some potential problems related to hyperprior selection in the previous work and study some possible solutions. A hyperprior sensitivity analysis is then performed, and the structure of the posterior distribution as revealed by the MCMC method is investigated. We show that the structure of the true posterior is rather complex with multiple modes corresponding to different possible solutions to the source reconstruction problem. We compare the results from the VB algorithm to those obtained from the MCMC simulation under different hyperparameter settings. The difficulties in using a unimodal variational distribution as a proxy for a truly multimodal distribution are also discussed. Simulated MEG data with realistic sensor and source geometries are used in performing the analyses. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Estimate of causality between independent cortical spatial patterns
   during movement volition in spinal cord injured patients
SO BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY
AB Static hemodynamic or neuroelectric images of brain regions activated during particular tasks do not convey the information of how these regions communicate to each other. Cortical connectivity estimation aims at describing these interactions as connectivity patterns which hold the direction and strength of the information flow between cortical areas. In this study, we attempted to estimate the causality between distributed cortical systems during a movement volition task in preparation for execution of simple movements by a group of normal healthy subjects and by a group of Spinal Cord Injured (SCI) patients. To estimate the causality between the spatial distributed patterns of cortical activity in the frequency domain, we applied a series of processing steps on the recorded EEG data. From the high-resolution EEG recordings we estimated the cortical waveforms for the regions of interest (ROIs), each representing a selected sensor group population. The solutions of the linear inverse problem returned a series of cortical waveforms for each ROI considered and for each trial analyzed. For each subject, the cortical waveforms were then subjected to Independent Component Analysis (ICA) pre-processing. The independent components obtained by the application of the ThinICA algorithm were further processed by a Partial Directed Coherence algorithm, in order to extract the causality between spatial cortical patterns of the estimated data. The source-target cortical dependencies found in the group of normal subjects were relatively similar in all frequency bands analyzed. For the normal subjects we observed a common source pattern in an ensemble of cortical areas including the right parietal and right lip primary motor areas and bilaterally the primary foot and posterior SMA areas. The target of this cortical network, in the Granger-sense of causality, was shown to be a smaller network composed mostly by the primary foot motor areas and the posterior SMA bilaterally. In the case of the SCI population, both the source and the target cortical patterns had larger sizes than in the normal population. The source cortical areas included always the primary foot and lip motor areas, often bilaterally. In addition, the right parietal area and the bilateral premotor area 6 were also involved. Again, the patterns remained substantially stable across the different frequency bands analyzed. The target cortical patterns observed in the SCI population had larger extensions when compared to the normal ones, since in most cases they involved the bilateral activation of the primary foot movement areas as well as the SMA, the primary lip areas and the parietal cortical areas.

TI Cross-modal attention capture by affective stimuli: Evidence from
   event-related potentials
SO COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE
AB The P3 component of the event-related potential (ERP) to an acoustic startle probe is modulated during picture viewing, with reduced P3 amplitude when participants view either pleasant or unpleasant, as opposed to neutral, pictures. We have interpreted this as reflecting capture of attentional resources by affective pictures, with fewer resources available for processing the secondary startle probe. In the present study, we tested this resource allocation hypothesis by presenting either pictures or sounds as foreground stimuli, with the prediction that P3 amplitude in response to secondary startle probes would be reduced for affectively engaging foregrounds regardless of modality Using dense-array electroencephalography and a source estimation procedure, we observed that P3 amplitude was indeed smaller when startle probes were presented during emotional, as opposed to neutral, stimuli for both sound and picture foregrounds. Source modeling indicated a common frontocentral maximum of P3 modulation by affect. The data support the notion that emotionally arousing stimuli transmodally attract resources, leading to optimized processing of the affective stimuli at the cost of the processing of concurrent stimuli.

TI Localization of individual area neuronal activity
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB A family of methods, collectively known as independent component analysis (ICA), has recently been added to the array of methods designed to decompose a multi-channel signal into components. ICA methods have been applied to raw magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) signals to remove artifacts, especially when sources such as power line or cardiac activity generate strong components that dominate the signal. More recently, successful ICA extraction of stimulus-evoked responses has been reported from single-trial raw MEG and EEG signals. The extraction of weak components has often been erratic, depending on which ICA method is employed and even on what parameters are used. In this work, we show that if the emphasis is placed on individual "independent components," as is usually the case with standard ICA applications, differences in the results obtained for different components are exaggerated. We propose instead the reconstruction of regional brain activations by combining tomographic estimates of individual independent components that have been selected by appropriate spatial and temporal criteria. Such localization of individual area neuronal activity (LIANA) allows reliable semi-automatic extraction of single-trial regional activations from raw MEG data. We demonstrate the new method with three different ICA algorithms applied to both computer-generated signals and real data. We show that LIANA provides almost identical results with each ICA method despite the fact that each method yields different individual components. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   covariance

CT 5th International Workshop on Biosignal Interpretation (BSI 2005)
CY SEP 06-08, 2005
CL Tokyo, JAPAN
AB Objective: The objective of this study is to explore suitable spatial filters for inverse estimation of cortical equivalent dipole layer imaging from the scalp electroencephalogram. We utilize cortical dipole source imaging to locate the possible generators of scalp-measured movement-related potentials (MRPs) in human.
   Methods: The effects of incorporating signal and noise covariance into inverse procedures were examined by computer simulations and experimental study. The parametric projection filter (PPF) and parametric Weiner filter (PWF) were applied to an inhomogeneous three-sphere head model under various noise conditions.
   Results: The present simulation results suggest that the PWF incorporating signal information provides better cortical dipole layer imaging results than the PPF and Tikhonov regularization under the condition of moderate and high correlation between signal and noise distributions. On the other hand, the PPF has better performance than other inverse filters under the condition of low correlation between signal and noise distributions. The proposed methods were applied to self-paced MRPs in order to identify the anatomic substrate locations of neural generators. The dipole layer distributions estimated by means of PPF are well-localized as compared with blurred scalp potential maps and dipole layer distribution estimated by Tikhonov regularization. The proposed methods demonstrated that the contralateral premotor cortex was preponderantly activated in relation to movement performance.
   Conclusions: In cortical dipole source imaging, the PWF has better performance especially when the correlation between the signal and noise is high. The proposed inverse method was applicable to human experiments of MRPs if the signal and noise covariances were obtained.

TI Short-term plasticity in the auditory system: Differential neural
   responses to perception and imagery of speech and music
SO RESTORATIVE NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSCIENCE
AB Purpose: In this EEG study we sought to examine the neuronal underpinnings of short-term plasticity as a top-down guided auditory learning process. We hypothesized, that (i) auditory imagery should elicit proper auditory evoked effects (N1/P2 complex) and a late positive component (LPC). Generally, based on recent human brain mapping studies we expected (ii) to observe the involvement of different temporal and parietal lobe areas in imagery and in perception of acoustic stimuli. Furthermore we predicted (iii) that temporal regions show an asymmetric trend due to the different specialization of the temporal lobes in processing speech and non-speech sounds. Finally we sought evidence supporting the notion that short-term training is sufficient to drive top-down activity in brain regions that are not normally recruited by sensory induced bottom up processing.
   Methods: 18 non-musicians partook in a 30 channels based EEG session that investigated spatio-temporal dynamics of auditory imagery of "consonant-vowel" (CV) syllables and piano triads. To control for conditioning effects, we split the volunteers in two matched groups comprising the same conditions (visual, auditory or bimodal stimulation) presented in a slightly different serial order. Furthermore the study presents electromagnetic source localization (LORETA) of perception and imagery of CV-and piano stimuli.
   Results: Our results imply that auditory imagery elicited similar electrophysiological effects at an early stage (N1/P2) as auditory stimulation. However, we found an additional LPC following the N1/P2 for auditory imagery only. Source estimation evinced bilateral engagement of anterior temporal cortex, which was generally stronger for imagery of music relative to imagery of speech. While we did not observe lateralized activity for the imagery of syllables we noted significantly increased rightward activation over the anterior supratemporal plane for musical imagery.
   Conclusion: Thus, we conclude that short-term top-down training based auditory imagery of music and speech prompts involvement of distinct neural circuits residing in the perisylvian cortex.

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB Electroencephalography (EEG) is an important tool for studying the brain functions and is becoming popular in clinical practice. In this paper, we develop four parametric EEG models to estimate current sources that are spatially distributed on a surface. Our models approximate the source shape and extent explicitly and can be applied to localize extended sources which are often encountered, e.g., in epilepsy diagnosis. We assume a realistic head model and solve the EEG forward problem using the boundary element method. We present the source models with increasing degrees of freedom, provide the forward solutions, and derive the maximum-likelihood estimates as well as Cramer-Rao bounds of the unknown source parameters. In order to evaluate the applicability of the proposed models, we first compare their estimation performances with the dipole model's using several known source distributions. We then discuss the conditions under which we can distinguish between the proposed extended sources and the focal dipole using the generalized likelihood ratio test. We also apply our models to the electric measurements obtained from a phantom body in which an extended electric source is imbedded. We observe that the proposed model can capture the source extent information satisfactorily and the localization accuracy is better than the dipole model.

TI Noninvasive source localization of interictal EEG spikes: Effects of
   signal-to-noise ratio and averaging
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB Source localization using single current dipoles estimates equivalent centers of the spiking gray matter. The extent of the active cortex, however, is difficult to assess from scalp EEG because of the unknown individual volume conduction. The spatial scatter of dipole localizations of single spikes has been proposed as a measure of extent. Single spike localization, however, is strongly dependent on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), that is, the ratio of spike and background EEG amplitudes. On the other hand, averaging of all spikes yields only the localization of equivalent centers of activity. We investigated the influence of SNR and multiple subaverages on the estimation of spatial extent by comparing the localization scatter of 100 single spikes in 27 spike types of 25 epilepsy patients with 1000 different subaverages computed by random sampling and bootstrapping. Averaging increased SNR and therefore allowed for localization not only at the spike peak but also during spike onset when less cortex is active. In several subjects with known cortical lesions, the single spike scatter considerably exceeded the lesion. Single dipole scatter was highly correlated with SNR (r = -0.83, P < 0.0001) and was greatly reduced when analyzing multiple subaverages of 10, 25, 50, and 100 spikes. Thus, we found a dominant role of the SNR on the estimated extent and improvement by scatterplots based on the dipole localization of randomly sampled subaverages.

TI Alpha-band activity reflects reduction of mental effort in a comparison
   task: A source space analysis
SO BRAIN RESEARCH
AB Comparison processes contribute to many core phenomena of social cognition research. Whenever humans judge a given target, they rely on comparisons with a pertinent standard. We propose that comparison processes may be so ubiquitous because they reduce mental effort. To investigate this possibility, we used dense-array Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings together with a minimum norm source projection approach. As the dependent variable, we examined changes in parietal alpha (8-12 Hz) amplitude during a judgment task. Spectral changes in the alpha frequency range have been reliably related to attentional load, cognitive arousal, or mental effort. Two groups of participants (n=22) were procedurally primed to solve a series of target judgments in a more comparative (experimental group) versus more absolute (control group) manner. While the participants performed the critical judgment tasks, we recorded changes in alpha amplitude. Continuous EEG was transformed into a spherical source space using the minimum norm (L2) estimate and spectral changes were subsequently calculated in the source domain. Statistical parametric mapping in combination with permutation statistics was employed to map regions showing significant group differences. Results demonstrate that comparative processing was associated with smaller changes in alpha amplitude than absolute processing. This difference was most pronounced at parietal source locations, where alpha reduction was at a maximum. Temporal analysis suggested that this effect was present particularly during task preparation and execution. We conclude that comparative information processing may reduce mental effort in judgment tasks. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Spatiotemporal noise covariance estimation from limited empirical
   magnetoencephalographic data
SO PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
AB The performance of parametric magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) source localization approaches can be degraded by the use of poor background noise covariance estimates. In general, estimation of the noise covariance for spatiotemporal analysis is difficult mainly due to the limited noise information available. Furthermore, its estimation requires a large amount of storage and a one-time but very large (and sometimes intractable) calculation or its inverse. To overcome these difficulties, noise covariance models consisting of one pair or a sum of multi-pairs of Kronecker products of spatial covariance and temporal covariance have been proposed. However, these approaches cannot be applied when the noise information is very limited, i.e., the amount of noise information is less than the degrees of freedom of the noise covariance models. A common example of this is when only averaged noise data are available for a limited prestimulus region (typically at most a few hundred milliseconds duration). For such cases, a diagonal spatiotemporal noise covariance model consisting of sensor variances with no spatial or temporal correlation has been the common choice for spatiotemporal analysis. In this work, we propose a different noise covariance model which consists of diagonal spatial noise covariance and Toeplitz temporal noise covariance. It can easily be estimated from limited noise information, and no time-consuming optimization and data-processing are required. Thus, it can be used as an alternative choice when one-pair or multi-pair noise covariance models cannot be estimated due to lack of noise information. To verify its capability we used Bayesian inference dipole analysis and a number of simulated and empirical datasets. We compared this covariance model with other existing covariance models such as conventional diagonal covariance, one-pair and multi-pair noise covariance models, when noise information is sufficient to estimate them. We found that our proposed noise covariance model yields better localization performance than a diagonal noise covariance, while it performs slightly worse than one-pair or multi-pair noise covariance models-although these require much more noise information. Finally, we present some localization results on median nerve stimulus empirical MEG data for our proposed noise covariance model.

TI Automated localization of magnetoencephalographic interictal spikes by
   adaptive spatial filtering
SO CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB Objective: Automated adaptive spatial filtering techniques can be applied to magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data collected from people with epilepsy. Source waveforms estimated by these methods have higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) than spontaneous MEG data, allowing identification and location of interictal spikes. The software tool SAM(g(2)) provides an adaptive spatial filtering algorithm for MEG data that yields source images of excess kurtosis and provides source time-courses in voxels exhibiting high excess kurtosis. The sensitivity and specificity of SAM(g(2)) in epilepsy is unknown.
   Methods: Interictal MEG data from 36 patients with intractable epilepsy were analyzed using SAM(g(2)), and results compared with equivalent current dipole (ECD) fit procedures.
   Results: When SNR of interictal spikes was high (compared to background) with a clear single focus, in most cases there was good agreement between ECD and SAM(g(2)). With multiple foci, there was typically overlap but imperfect concordance between results of ECD and SAM(g(2)).
   Conclusions: SAM(g(2)) may in some cases be equivalent to manual ECD fit for localizing interictal spikes with single locus and good SNR. Further studies are required to validate SAM(g(2)) with multiple foci or poor SNR.
   Significance: In some cases, SAM(g(2)) might eventually assist or replace manual ECD analysis of MEG data. (c) 2006 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Estimation of number of independent, brain electric sources from the
   scalp EEGs
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB In electromagnetic source analysis, many source localization strategies require the number of sources as an input parameter (e.g., spatio-temporal dipole fitting and the multiple signal classification). In the present study, an information criterion method, in which the penalty functions are selected based on the spatio-temporal source model, has been developed to estimate the number of independent dipole sources from, electromagnetic measurements such as the electroencephalogram (EEG). Computer simulations were conducted to evaluate the effects of various parameters on the estimation of the source number. A three-concentric-spheres head model was used to approximate the head volume conductor. Three kinds of typical signal sources, i.e., the damped sinusoid sources, sinusoid sources with one frequency band and sinusoid sources with two separated frequency bands, were used to simulate the oscillation characteristics of brain electric sources. The simulation results suggest that the present method can provide a good estimate of the number of independent dipole sources from the EEG measurements. In addition, the present simulation results suggest that choosing the optimal penalty function can successfully reduce the effect of noise on the estimation of number of independent sources. The present study suggests that the information criterion method may provide a useful means in estimating the number of independent brain electrical sources from EEG/MEG measurements.

TI Improved performance of Bayesian solutions for inverse
   Electrocardiography using multiple information sources
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB The usual goal in inverse electrocardiography (ECG) is to reconstruct cardiac electrical sources from body surface potentials and a mathematical model that relates the sources to the measurements. Due to attenuation and smoothing that occurs in the thorax, the inverse ECG problem is ill-posed and imposition of a priori constraints is needed to combat this ill-posedness. When the problem is posed in terms of reconstructing heart surface potentials, solutions have not yet achieved clinical utility; limitations include the limited availability of good a priori information about the solution and the lack of a "good" error metric. We describe an approach that combines body surface measurements and standard forward models with two additional information sources: statistical prior information about epicardial potential distributions and sparse simultaneous measurements of epicardial potentials made with multielectrode coronary venous catheters. We employ a Bayesian methodology which offers a general way to incorporate these information sources and additionally provides statistical performance analysis tools. In a simulation study, we first compare solutions using one or more of these information sources. Then, we study the effects of varying the number of sparse epicardial potential measurements on reconstruction accuracy. To evaluate accuracy, we used the Bayesian error covariance as well as traditional error metrics such as relative error. Our results show that including even sparsely sampled information from coronary venous catheters can substantially improve the reconstruction of epicardial potential distributions and that a Bayesian framework provides a feasible approach to using this information. Moreover, computing the Bayesian error standard deviations offers a means to indicate confidence in the results even in the absence of validation data.

TI Source estimation of spontaneous MEG oscillations in mild cognitive
   impairment
SO NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS
AB Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a memory disorder often preceding Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD has been shown to be associated with abnormal generation of spontaneous electromagnetic activity. We investigated whether the cortical generation of spontaneous brain oscillations in MCI shows changes resembling those observed in AD. A minimum current estimates algorithm was applied to identify cortical sources of magnetoencephalographic (MEG) spontaneous brain oscillations in male MCI patients with a clear memory disorder and in healthy elderly controls. This data was subsequently compared to a male subsample of AD patients from an earlier study. While there were clear oscillatory abnormalities in AD patients, there was no evidence of significant changes in the alpha source distribution in MCI patients as compared to healthy controls. Deficits in the distribution of oscillatory sources in the resting state are thus likely to occur at later stages of cognitive impairment than MCI. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI The physiological basis for continuous electroencephalogram monitoring
   in the neonate
SO CLINICS IN PERINATOLOGY
AB The overall aims in the care of the sick newborn are the preservation of brain function and optimal neurologic and developmental outcome. Paradoxically, online continuous functional monitoring in the neonate has traditionally focused on cardiorespiratory variables rather than cerebral function. Electrophysiological brain activity, as reflected by electroencephalogram (EEG), is well established as a tool for providing information about the current functional and metabolic state of the brain and the occurrence of epileptic seizure episodes. In neonatal care, EEG has been used extensively for estimation of the degree of cerebral maturation in preterm infants and for detection of abnormal patterns indicating focal and global cerebral lesions [1-3]. In the neonatal setting, as well as in intensive care in general, the EEG has been recorded intermittently, at best serially rather than continuously. Performing a full multichannel EEG in a newborn requires specialized technical skill in securing correct electrode positioning and impedances, as well as identification of extracerebral biologic and nonbiologic artifact sources. Interpretation of neonatal EEG is considered among clinical neurophysiologists a demanding task that must consider the specific EEG features related to different gestational age, activity state, and medication.
   The main disadvantage with intermittent conventional EEG during neonatal care is the difficulty in discriminating emerging trends of development of the electrocerebral activity over hours and days. If possible at all, it takes special skills not usually available in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) to identify long-term changes of EEG patterns. To have an impact on intensive care, monitoring of the electrocortical activity should have a continuous, simple recording setup and a small number of recording electrodes. Furthermore, EEG features that are immediately relevant for clinical decisions should be continuously available at the bedside and easily interpreted by the attending physician day and night. Such techniques have been applied for a long time in intensive care and anesthesia. It has also been used in neonatal monitoring, usually derived from a spectral analysis by fast Fourier transform (FFT) and presented as compressed spectral arrays (CSA) or spectral edge frequency (SE) [4].

TI Bayesian estimation of evoked and induced responses
SO HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING
AB We describe an extension of our empirical Bayes approach to magnetoencephalography/electroencephalography (MEG/EEG) source reconstruction that covers both evoked and induced responses. The estimation scheme is based on classical covariance component estimation using restricted maximum likelihood (ReML). We have focused previously on the estimation of spatial covariance components under simple assumptions about the temporal correlations. Here we extend the scheme using temporal basis functions to place constraints on the temporal form of the responses. We show how the same scheme can estimate evoked responses that are phase-locked to the stimulus and induced responses that are not. For a single trial the model is exactly the same, In the context of multiple trials, however, the inherent distinction between evoked and induced responses calls for different treatments of the underlying hierarchical multitrial model. We derive the respective models and show how they can be estimated efficiently using ReML. This enables the Bayesian estimation of evoked and induced changes in power or, more generally, the energy of wavelet coefficients.

TI Influence of anisotropic conductivity on EEG source reconstruction:
   Investigations in a rabbit model
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB The aim of our work was to quantify the influence of white matter anisotropic conductivity information on electroencephalogFaphy (EEG) source reconstruction. We performed this quantification in a rabbit head using both simulations and source localization based on invasive measurements. In vivo anisotropic (tensorial) conductivity information was obtained from magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging and included into a high-resolution finite-element model. When neglecting anisotropy in the simulations, we found a shift in source location of up to 1.3 min with a mean value of 0.3 mm. The averaged orientational deviation was 10 degree and the mean magnitude error of the dipole was 29 %. Source localization of the first cortical components after median and tibial nerve stimulation resulted in anatomically verified dipole positions with no significant anisotropy effect. Our results indicate that the expected average source localization error due to anisotropic white matter conductivity is within the principal accuracy limits of current inverse procedures. However, larger localization errors might occur in certain cases. In contrast, dipole orientation and dipole strength are influenced significantly by the anisotropy. We conclude that the inclusion of tissue anisotropy information improves source estimation procedures.

TI 3D source localization of interictal spikes in epilepsy patients with
   MRI lesions
SO PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
AB The present study aims to accurately localize epileptogenic regions which are responsible for epileptic activities in epilepsy patients by means of a new subspace source localization approach, i.e. first principle vectors (FINE), using scalp EEG recordings. Computer simulations were first performed to assess source localization accuracy of FINE in the clinical electrode set-up. The source localization results from FINE were compared with the results from a classic subspace source localization approach, i.e. MUSIC, and their differences were tested statistically using the paired t-test. Other factors influencing the source localization accuracy were assessed statistically by ANOVA. The interictal epileptiform spike data from three adult epilepsy patients with medically intractable partial epilepsy and well-defined symptomatic MRI lesions were then studied using both FINE and MUSIC. The comparison between the electrical sources estimated by the subspace source localization approaches and MRI lesions was made through the coregistration between the EEG recordings and MRI scans. The accuracy of estimations made by FINE and MUSIC was also evaluated and compared by R-2 statistic, which was used to indicate the goodness-of-fit of the estimated sources to the scalp EEG recordings. The three-concentric-spheres head volume conductor model was built for each patient with three spheres of different radii which takes the individual head size and skull thickness into consideration. The results from computer simulations indicate that the improvement of source spatial resolvability and localization accuracy of FINE as compared with MUSIC is significant when simulated sources are closely spaced, deep, or signal-to-noise ratio is low in a clinical electrode set-up. The interictal electrical generators estimated by FINE and MUSIC are in concordance with the patients' structural abnormality, i.e. MRI lesions, in all three patients. The higher R2 values achieved by FINE than MUSIC indicate that FINE provides a more satisfactory fitting of the scalp potential measurements than MUSIC in all patients. The present results suggest that FINE provides a useful brain source imaging technique, from clinical EEG recordings, for identifying and localizing epileptogenic regions in epilepsy patients with focal partial seizures. The present study may lead to the establishment of a high-resolution source localization technique from scalp-recorded EEGs for aiding presurgical planning in epilepsy patients.

TI The categorization of natural scenes: Brain attention networks revealed
   by dense sensor ERPs
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB The present study examined cortical indicators of selective attention underlying categorization based on target features in natural scenes. The primary focus was to determine the neural sources associated with the processing of target stimuli containing animals compared to nontarget control stimuli. Neural source estimation techniques [current source density (CSD) and L2-minimum norm estimate (L2-MNE)] were used to determine the sources of the potential fields measured from 58 sensor sites. Assuring an excellent signal-to-noise ratio, the categorization task consisted of 2400 trials. Replicating previous findings, target and non-target ERP activity diverged sharply around 150 ms after stimulus onset and the early differential ERP activity appeared as positive deflection over fronto-central sensor sites and as negative deflection over temporo-occipital regions. Both source estimation techniques (CSD and L2-MNE) suggested primary sources of the early differential ERP activity in posterior, visual-associative brain regions and, although less pronounced, revealed the contribution of additional anterior sources. These findings suggest that selective attention to category-relevant features reflects the interactions between prefrontal and inferior temporal cortex during visual processing of natural scenes.

TI Removal of the ocular artifacts from EEG data using a cascaded
   spatio-temporal processing
SO COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE
AB Eye movements and blinks may produce unusual voltage changes in human electroencephalogram (EEG). These effects may spread across scalp and mask brain signals. In this paper, a cascaded spatio-temporal processing procedure (CAST) is presented to remove artifact electrooculogram (EOG). Firstly a discrete equivalent distributed source on the cortical surface is reconstructed from the contaminated scalp recordings by a linear minimum norm estimation (i.e. a spatial analysis step). Then, the equivalent sources of EOG are identified by principal component analysis (PCA) of the equivalent distributed source time series (i.e. a temporal analysis step). Finally, the EOG-corrected scalp EEG is reconstructed from the equivalent distributed source where EOG components have been removed. The effectiveness of CAST is confirmed by the application to actual scalp data and a detailed comparative study. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In general, existing blind source separation (BSS) algorithms have been designed based on assumptions that there are at least an equal number of sources and sensors and/or there is no noise present. These ideal situations rarely exist and hence the algorithms do not produce optimum results where either one or both of the assumptions have been violated. Underdetermined mixtures where the number of source signals is greater than the number of observed signals are encountered in neural signal detection from a small number of sensors, image modelling, EEG data and biomedical applications. A new algorithm to estimate unknown source signals from fewer observed signals and simultaneously reduce noise is proposed. The proposed algorithm is based upon a model that addresses the issue of noise and offers greater accuracy with standard assumptions relaxed. It offers an attractive solution with no pre-requisites on the nature of the signals and noise for the algorithm to be applicable. Most BSS algorithms adopt batch processing and are only applicable to orthogonal mixtures. The proposed algorithm does not require the mixing matrix to be orthogonal and can be implemented in an adaptive format to track time-varying mixtures. Results supporting the algorithm's superiority and comparisons with results from other algorithms are also presented to prove the tracking capability of our adaptive algorithm. Synthetic and realtime simulations demonstrate the improvement in convergence and accuracy of estimated signals with fewer restrictions in terms of its applicability.

TI Subspace projection filters for real-time brain electromagnetic imaging
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB An increasing number of neuroimaging laboratories are becoming interested in real-time investigations of the human brain. The opportunities offered by real-time applications are inversely proportional to the latency of the brain activity response and to the computational delay of brain activity estimation. Electromagnetic tomographies, based on electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG), feature immediacy of brain activity response and excellent time resolution, hence they are natural candidates. However their spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio are poor. In this paper, we develop data-independent and data-dependent subspace projection filters for the standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA), a weighted minimum norm inverse solution for EEG/MEG. The filters are designed for extracting time-series of source activity in any given region of interest. The data-independent filter is shown to reduce interference of sources originating in neighboring regions, whereas the data-dependent filter is shown to suppress sensor measurement noise. An effective and straightforward way to combine them is demonstrated. The result is a dual subspace projection allowing both noise suppression and interference reduction.

TI Effects of fMRI-EEG mismatches in cortical current density estimation
   integrating RWRI and EEG: A simulation study
SO CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB Objective: Multimodal functional neuroimaging by combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) has been studied to achieve high-resolution reconstruction of the spatiotemporal cortical current density (CCD) distribution. However, mismatches between these two imaging modalities may occur due to their different underlying mechanisms. The aim of the present study is to investigate the effects of different types of fMRI-EEG mismatches, including fMRI invisible sources, fMRI extra regions and fMRI displacement, on the fMRI-constrained cortical imaging in a computer simulation based on realistic-geometry boundary-element-method (BEM) model.
   Methods: Two methods have been adopted to integrate the synthetic fMRI and EEG data for CCD imaging. In addition to the well-known 90% fMRI-constrained Wiener filter approach (Liu AK, Belliveau JW, Dale AM. PNAS 1998;95:8945-8950.), we propose a novel two-step algorithm (referred to as 'Twomey algorithm') for fMRI-EEG integration. In the first step, a 'hard' spatial prior derived from fMRI is imposed to solve the EEG inverse problem with a reduced source space; in the second step, the fMRI constraint is removed and the source estimate from the first step is re-entered as the initial guess of the desired solution into an EEG least squares fitting procedure with Twomey regularization. Twomey regularization is a modified Tikhonov technique that attempts to simultaneously minimize the distance between the desired solution and the initial estimate, and the residual errors of fitness to EEG data. The performance of the proposed Twomey algorithm has been evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively along with the lead-field normalized minimum norm (WMN) and the 90% fMRI-weighted Wiener filter approach, under repeated and randomized source configurations. Point spread function (PSF) and localization error (LE) are used to measure the performance of different imaging approaches with or without a variety of fMRI-EEG mismatches. Results: The results of the simulation show that the Twomey algorithm can successfully reduce the PSF of fMRI invisible sources compared to the Wiener estimation, without losing the merit of having much lower PSF of fMRI visible sources relative to the WMN solution. In addition, the existence of fMRI extra sources does not significantly affect the accuracy of the fMRI-EEG integrated CCD estimation for both the Wiener filter method and the proposed Twomey algorithm, while the Twomey algorithm may further reduce the chance of occurring spurious sources in the extra fMRI regions. The fMRI displacement away from the electrical source causes enlarged localization error in the imaging results of both the Twomey and Wiener approaches, while Twomey gives smaller LE than Wiener with the fMRI displacement ranging from 1-2 cm. With less than 2 cm fMRI displacement, the LEs for the Twomey and Wiener approaches are still smaller than in the WMN solution.
   Conclusions: The present study suggests that the presence of fMRI invisible sources is the most problematic factor responsible for the error of fMRI-EEG integrated imaging based on the Wiener filter approach, whereas this approach is relatively robust against the fMRI extra regions and small displacement between fMRI activation and electrical current sources. While maintaining the above advantages possessed by the Wiener filter approach, the Twomey algorithm can further effectively alleviate the underestimation of fMRI invisible sources, suppress fMRI spurious sources and improve the robustness against fMRI displacement. Therefore, the Twomey algorithm is expected to improve the reliability of multimodal cortical source imaging against fMRI-EEG mismatches.
   Significance: The proposed method promises to provide a useful alternative for multimodal neuroimaging integrating fMRI and EEG. (c) 2006 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI The spatio-temporal brain dynamics of processing and integrating sound
   localization cues in humans
SO BRAIN RESEARCH
AB Interaural intensity and time differences (IID and ITD) are two binaural auditory cues for localizing sounds in space. This study investigated the spatio-temporal brain mechanisms for processing and integrating IID and ITD cues in humans. Auditory-evoked potentials were recorded, while subjects passively listened to noise bursts lateralized with IID, ITD or both cues simultaneously, as well as a more frequent centrally presented noise. In a separate psychophysical experiment, subjects actively discriminated lateralized from centrally presented stimuli. IID and ITD cues elicited different electric field topographies starting at similar to 75 ms post-stimulus onset, indicative of the engagement of distinct cortical networks. By contrast, no performance differences were observed between IID and ITD cues during the psychophysical experiment. Subjects did, however, respond significantly faster and more accurately when both cues were presented simultaneously. This performance facilitation exceeded predictions from probability summation, suggestive of interactions in neural processing of IID and ITD cues. Supra-additive neural response interactions as well as topographic modulations were indeed observed similar to 200 ms post-stimulus for the comparison of responses to the simultaneous presentation of both cues with the mean of those to separate IID and ITD cues. Source estimations revealed differential processing of IID and ITD cues initially within superior temporal cortices and also at later stages within temporoparietal and inferior frontal cortices. Differences were principally in terms of hemispheric lateralization. The collective psychophysical and electrophysiological results support the hypothesis that IID and ITD cues are processed by distinct, but interacting, cortical networks that can in turn facilitate auditory localization.

TI The time course of visual word recognition as revealed by linear
   regression analysis of ERP data
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB EEG correlates of a range of psycholinguistic word properties were used to investigate the time course of access to psycholinguistic information during visual word recognition. Neurophysiological responses recorded in a visual lexical decision task were submitted to linear regression analysis. First, 10 psycholinguistic features of each of 300 stimulus words were submitted to a principal component analysis, which yielded four orthogonal variables likely to reflect separable processes in visual word recognition: Word length, Letter n-gram frequency, Lexical frequency and Semantic coherence of a word's morphological family. Since the lexical decision task required subjects to distinguish between words and pseudowords, the binary variable Lexicality was also investigated using a factorial design. Word-pseudoword differences in the event-related potential first appeared at 160 ins after word onset. However, regression analysis of EEG data documented a much earlier effect of both Word length and Letter n-gram frequency around 90 ins. Lexical frequency showed its earliest effect slightly later, at 110 ms, and Semantic coherence significantly correlated with neurophysiological measures around 160 ms, simultaneously with the lexicality effect. Source estimates indicated parieto-temporo-occipital generators for the factors Length, Letter n-gram frequency and Word frequency, but widespread activation with foci in left anterior temporal lobe and inferior frontal cortex related to Semantic coherence. At later stages (> 200 ms), all variables exhibited simultaneous EEG correlates. These results indicate that information about surface form and meaning of a lexical item is first accessed at different times in different brain systems and then processed simultaneously, thus supporting cascaded interactive processing models.

TI MEG source localization under multiple constraints: An extended Bayesian
   framework
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB To use Electroencephalography (EEG) and Magnetoencephalography (MEG) as functional brain 3D imaging techniques, identifiable distributed source models are required. The reconstruction of EEG/MEG sources rests on inverting these models and is ill-posed because the solution does not depend continuously on the data and there is no unique solution in the absence of prior in formation or constraints. We have described a general framework that can account for several priors in a common inverse solution. An empirical Bayesian framework based on hierarchical linear models was proposed for the analysis of functional neuroimaging data [Friston, K., Penny, W, Phillips, C., Kiebel, S., Hinton, G., Ashburner, J., 2002. Classical and BaN inference in neuroitnaging: theory. Neurolmage 16, 465-483] and was evaluated recently in the context of EEG [Phillips, C., Mattout, J., Rugg, M.D., Maquet, P., Friston, K., 2005. An empirical Bayesian solution to the source reconstruction problem in EEG. Neurolmage 24, 997-1011]. The approach consists of estimating the expected source distribution and its conditional variance that is constrained by an empirically determined mixture of prior variance components. Estimation uses Expectation-Maximization (EM) to give the Restricted Maximum Likelihood (ReML) estimate of the variance components (in terms of hyperparameters) and the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimate of the source parameters. In this paper, we extend the framework to compare different combinations of priors, using a second level of inference based on Bayesian model selection. Using Monte- Carlo simulations, ReML is first compared to a classic Weighted Minimum Norm (WMN) solution under a single constraint. Then, the ReML estimates are evaluated using various combinations of priors. Both standard criterion and ROC-based measures were used to assess localization and detection performance. The empirical Bayes approach proved useful as: (1) ReML was significantly better than WMN for single priors; (2) valid location priors improved ReML source localization; (3) invalid location priors did not significantly impair performance. Finally, we show how model selection, using the log-evidence, can be used to select file best combination of priors. This enables a global strategy for multiple prior-based regularization of the MEG/EEG source reconstruction. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MAGNETICS

CY JUN 26-30, 2005
CL Shenyang, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB In this paper, an improved magnetoencephalography (MEG) source reconstruction technique considering anatomical connectivity of cortical sources is proposed. The anatomical connectivity information was taken into account by calculating three-dimensional geodesic distance between neighboring sources, and then the resultant inverse solutions were compared with those of other cases: 1) inverse estimate without connectivity information; 2) use of Euclidean distance instead of geodesic distance. The proposed technique was applied to realistic simulations for a real brain anatomy, and the results showed that estimated sources can be smoother and more accurate by using the anatomical connectivity information.

TI Independent component analysis identifies ictal bitemporal activity in
   intracranial recordings at the time of unilateral discharges
SO CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB Objective: To apply independent component analysis (ICA) in intracranial recordings to analyze interactions during temporal lobe seizures.
   Methods: Seizures from 20 patients with bitemporal implantation were classified as unilateral or bilateral and analyzed with ICA. During the period preceding bilateral activity, correlation coefficients were calculated between ICA components having ictal activity during the unilateral seizure phase (early ICA components) and every channel of the original EEG. ICA components were classified as unilateral if the correlation was > 0.2 exclusively with channels in one hemisphere; and bilateral if both hemispheres were involved.
   Results: One hundred twenty-three seizures were analyzed. Thirty-two percent of visually classified unilateral seizures and 64% of bilateral seizures (during the unilateral phase) had bilateral ICA components. The proportion of early ICA components that were bilateral and the proportion of channels contralateral to the visually identified seizure with correlation higher than 0.2 with at least one early ICA component were significantly lower in seizures that stayed unilateral than in seizures that later became bilateral by visual inspection (11 and 10%, respectively, in unilateral seizures; 33 and 28% in bilateral seizures; P=0.001).
   Conclusions: In patients with bitemporal epilepsy, approximately 20% of the components extracted using ICA have a bitemporal distribution even at the time when the seizures are apparently unilateral. The presence of early contralateral ictal activity is more frequent and extensive in Seizures that later become evidently bilateral.
   Significance: Minimal contralateral seizure activity is present even when the discharge appears unilateral and this is more frequent in seizures which later spread to the contralateral temporal lobe.

TI Bayesian spatio-temporal approach for EEG source reconstruction:
   Conciliating ECD and distributed models
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB Characterizing the cortical activity sources of electroencephalography (EEG)/magnetoencephalography data is a critical issue since it requires solving an ill-posed inverse problem that does not admit a unique solution. Two main different and complementary source models have emerged: equivalent current dipoles (ECD) and distributed linear (DL) models. While ECD models remain highly popular since they provide an easy way to interpret the solutions, DL models (also referred to as imaging techniques) are known to be more realistic and flexible. In this paper, we show how those two representations of the brain electromagnetic activity can be cast into a common general framework yielding an optimal description and estimation of the EEG sources. From this extended source mixing model, we derive a hybrid approach whose key aspect is the separation between temporal and spatial characteristics of brain activity, which allows to dramatically reduce the number of DL model parameters. Furthermore, the spatial profile of the sources, as a temporal invariant map, is estimated using the entire time window data, allowing to significantly enhance the information available about the spatial aspect of the EEG inverse problem. A Bayesian framework is introduced to incorporate distinct temporal and spatial constraints on the solution and to estimate both parameters and hyperparameters of the model. Using simulated EEG data, the proposed inverse approach is evaluated and compared with standard distributed methods using both classical criteria and ROC curves.

TI Blind estimation of channel parameters and source components for EEG
   signals: A sparse factorization approach
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS
AB In this paper, we use a two-stage sparse factorization approach for blindly estimating the channel parameters and then estimating source components for electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. EEG signals are assumed to be linear mixtures of source components, artifacts, etc. Therefore, a raw EEG data matrix can be factored into the product of two matrices, one of which represents the mixing matrix and the other the source component matrix. Furthermore, the components are sparse in the time-frequency domain, i.e., the factorization is a sparse factorization in the time frequency domain. It is a challenging task to estimate the mixing matrix. Our extensive analysis and computational results, which were based on many sets of EEG data, not only provide firm evidences supporting the above assumption, but also prompt us to propose a new algorithm for estimating the mixing matrix. After the mixing matrix is estimated, the source components are estimated in the time frequency domain using a linear programming method. In an example of the potential applications of our approach, we analyzed the EEG data that was obtained from a modified Sternberg memory experiment. Two almost uncorrelated components obtained by applying the sparse factorization method were selected for phase synchronization analysis. Several interesting findings were obtained, especially that memory-related synchronization and desynchronization appear in the alpha band, and that the strength of alpha band synchronization is related to memory performance.

TI The sound of actions as reflected by mismatch negativity: rapid
   activation of cortical sensory-motor networks by sounds associated with
   finger and tongue movements
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE
AB In order to explore the activation dynamics of the human action recognition system, we investigated electrophysiological distinctions between the brain responses to sounds produced by human finger and tongue movements. Of special interest were the questions of how early these differences may occur, and whether the neural activation at the early stages of processing involves cortical motor representations related to the generation of these sounds. For this purpose we employed a high-density EEG set-up and recorded mismatch negativity (MMN) using a recently developed novel multideviant paradigm which allows acquisition of a high number of trials within a given time period. Deviant stimuli were naturally recorded finger and tongue clicks, as well as control stimuli with similar physical features but without the clear action associations (this was tested in a separate behavioural experiment). Both natural stimuli produced larger MMNs than their respective control stimuli at similar to 100 ms, indicating activation of memory traces for familiar action-related sounds. Furthermore, MMN topography at this latency differed between the brain responses to the natural finger and natural tongue sounds. Source estimation revealed the strongest sources for finger sounds in centrolateral areas of the left hemisphere, suggesting that hearing a sound related to finger actions evokes activity in motor areas associated with the dominant hand. Furthermore, tongue sounds produced activation in more inferior brain areas. Our data suggest that motor areas in the human brain are part of neural systems subserving the early automatic recognition of action-related sounds.

AB Independent component analysis (ICA) is a novel system that finds independent sources in recorded signals. Its usefulness in separating epileptiform activity of different origin has not been determined. The goal of this study was to demonstrate that ICA is useful for separating different spikes using samples of EEG of patients with focal epilepsy. Digital EEG samples from four patients with focal epilepsy were included. The patients had temporal (n = 2), centrotemporal (n = 1) or frontal spikes (n = 1). Twenty-six samples with two (or more) spikes from two different patients were created. The selection of the two spikes for each mixed EEG was performed randomly, trying to have all the different combinations and rejecting the mixture of two spikes from the same patient. Two different examiners studied the EEGs using ICA with JADE paradigm in Matlab platform, trying to separate and to identify the spikes. They agreed in the correct separation of the spikes in 24 of the 26 samples, classifying the spikes as frontal, temporal or centrotemporal, left or right sided. The demonstration of the possibility of detecting different artificially mixed spikes confirms that ICA may be useful in separating spikes or other elements in real EEGs.

AB A current goal of affective neuroscience is to reveal the relationship between emotion and dynamic brain activity in specific neural circuits. In humans, noninvasive neuroimaging measures are of primary interest in this endeavor. However, methodological issues, unique to each neuroimaging method, have important implications for the design of studies, interpretation of findings, and comparison across studies. With regard to event-related brain potentials, we discuss the need for dense sensor arrays to achieve reference-independent characterization of field potentials and improved estimate of cortical brain sources. Furthermore, limitations and caveats regarding sparse sensor sampling are discussed. With regard to event-related magnetic field (ERF) recordings, we outline a method to achieve magnetoencephalography (MEG) sensor standardization, which improves effects' sizes in typical neuroscientific investigations, avoids the finding of ghost effects, and facilitates comparison of MEG waveforms across studies. Focusing on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we question the unjustified application of proportional global signal scaling in emotion research, which can greatly distort statistical findings in key structures implicated in emotional processing and possibly contributing to conflicting results in affective neuroscience fMRI studies, in particular with respect to limbic and paralimbic structures. Finally, a distributed EEG/MEG source analysis with statistical parametric mapping is outlined providing a common software platform for hemodynamic and electromagnetic neuroimaging measures. Taken together, to achieve consistent and replicable patterns of the relationship between emotion and neuroimaging measures, methodological aspects associated with the various neuroimaging techniques may be of similar importance as the definition of emotional cues and task context used to study emotion.

TI Independent component analysis in the distinction between focal and
   multifocal spikes
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB Independent component analysis (ICA) is a novel method that extracts independent sources in recorded signals. One of its capabilities is to separate epileptiform activity of different origins. The goal of this study was to demonstrate that ICA is useful for differentiating focal and multifocal epilepsies. Using ICA, the authors analyzed 160 samples of patients with unifocal (temporal: 50 samples from 5 patients; frontal: 50 samples from 5 patients) or multifocal epilepsy (bitemporal: 30 samples from 3 patients, multifocal extratemporal: 30 samples from 5 patients). Each sample included at least two spikes. ICA was applied using the JADE algorithm implemented in a Matlab platform. The components were identified visually. The EEG and the isopotential map of the suspected components were reconstructed to demonstrate the nature and location of each spike. In multifocal epilepsies, the spikes were separated in distinct components in all cases. In unifiocal temporal epilepsies, ICA extracted all the spikes from the same location into a single component. In the patients with unifocal frontal epilepsy, one component included all the spikes in 80% of the samples; in some of these cases, other components were responsible for small parts of the spikes, but with a close topography to the main component. The waves were separated in different components both in the unifocal and in the multifocal samples. Therefore, in epilepsies with independent foci, ICA separates the spiked of different origins into distinct components. In unifocal epilepsies, ICA tends to locate the spikes from the same area into the same component, especially in temporal epilepsies. The authors conclude that ICA might be a useful tool to distinguish between unifocal and multifocal epilepsies.

TI Fully complex magnetoencephalography
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS
AB Complex numbers appear naturally in biology whenever a system can be analyzed in the frequency domain, such as physiological data from magnetoencephalography (MEG). For example, the MEG steady state response to a modulated auditory stimulus generates a complex magnetic field for each MEG channel, equal to the Fourier transform at the stimulus modulation frequency. The complex nature of these data sets, often not taken advantage of, is fully exploited here with new methods. Whole-head, complex magnetic data can be used to estimate complex neural current sources, and standard methods of source estimation naturally generalize for complex sources. We show that a general complex neural vector source is described by its location, magnitude, and direction, but also by a phase and by an additional perpendicular component. We give natural interpretations of all the parameters for the complex equivalent-current dipole by linking them to the underlying neurophysiology. We demonstrate complex magnetic fields, and their equivalent fully complex current sources, with both simulations and experimental data. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Recipes for the linear analysis of EEG
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB In this paper, we describe a simple set of "recipes" for the analysis of high spatial density EEG. We focus on a linear integration of multiple channels for extracting individual components without making any spatial or anatomical modeling assumptions, instead requiring particular statistical properties such as maximum difference, maximum power, or statistical independence. We demonstrate how corresponding algorithms, for example, linear discriminant analysis, principal component analysis and independent component analysis, can be used to remove eye-motion artifacts, extract strong evoked responses, and decompose temporally overlapping components. The general approach is shown to be consistent with the underlying physics of EEG, which specifies a linear mixing model of the underlying neural and non-neural current sources.

TI Benign partial epilepsy in childhood: Selective cognitive deficits are
   related to the location of focal spikes determined by combined EEG/MEG
SO EPILEPSIA
AB Purpose: Benign partial epilepsy (BPE) in childhood is characterized by the occurrence of interictal stereotyped focal spikes with variable localization in the EEG. Children with BPE often exhibit neuropsychological deficits. It is unclear whether a correlation exists between these deficits and the localization of spikes, several EEG studies giving inconsistent results. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) improves the accuracy of spike localization. Therefore by using combined MEG/EEG, we investigated the topographic relation between focal spikes and neuropsychological findings in children with BPE.
   Methods: Twenty-seven children diagnosed consecutively with BPE were enrolled in the study. All were examined by combined MEG/EEG and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Location of spikes was determined by dipole source estimation. A standardized neuropsychological assessment was conducted, including Kaufman ABC battery, language tests, and motor performance series. All children with sufficient MEG data were included in the correlation analysis (N = 20).
   Results: Focal spikes were located in the perisylvian region in 13 children, in the occipital region in seven, and in the frontal region in one. Five children had bilateral or multiple foci. Children with left perisylvian spikes did not differ from the others in global IQ, but performed significantly lower in language tests (p = 0.01). Children with occipital spikes performed significantly lower in simultaneous information processing (p = 0.01), especially in visual transformation tasks.
   Conclusions: Combined MEG/EEG investigation is a useful tool to examine interictal focal spikes. Our results show a correlation between the location of spikes and selective cognitive deficits in children with BPE. These findings indicate that focal interictal spikes may interfere with complex cognitive functions.

TI fMRI-constrained MEG source imaging and consideration of fMRI invisible
   sources
SO HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING
AB Recent studies on multimodal brain source imaging have shown that the use of functional MRI (fMRI),prior information could enhance spatial resolution of magnetoencephalography (MEG), while MEG could compensate poor temporal resolution of fMRI. This article deals with a multimodal imaging method, which combines fMRI and MEG for enhancing both spatial and temporal resolutions. Recent studies on the combination of fMRI and MEG have suggested that the fMRI prior information could be very easily implemented by just giving different weighting factors to the diagonal terms of source covariance matrix in linear inverse operator. We applied the fMRI constrained imaging method to several simulation data and experimental data (Japanese language lexical judgment experiment), and found that some MEG sources may be eliminated by the introduction of the fMRI weighting and the eliminated sources may affect source estimation in fMRI activation regions. In this article, in order to check whether the eliminated sources were fMRI invisible ones or just spurious ones, we placed small numbers of regional sources (rotating dipoles) around all possible activation regions and investigated their temporal changes. By investigating the results carefully, we could evaluate whether the missed sources were real or not.

AB Short-term memory encoding of visual patterns in the human brain refers to the formation of neural codes which can be used further in a wide range of working memory processes. In our present study reported in this paper, multichannel whole-head magnetoencephalogram and electroencephalogram were recorded from human subjects during performance of continuous I-back comparison short-term memory tasks with pictorial stimuli. Estimation of the temporal dynamics of this process and source localization of the involved brain cortical generators was based on distributed inverse algorithms applied to the computed visual event-related fields (ERFs) and potefitials (ERPs). The major time-domain electromagnetic responses related to the short-term episodic memory encoding of the presented single stimuli were estimated to start 300 ms after stimulus onset and continued until the disappearance of the stimuli. Source estimation showed a significant activation in the left inferior medial temporal lobe related to intentional encoding processes.

AB Spatial distribution of anisotropic conductivity of the human brain was obtained using magnetic resonance imaging. The fast compo- nent of diffusion was estimated from the relation between the b-factor and the signal intensity of magnetic resonance images. Estimation of conductivity is based on the proportionality between conductivity and the diffusion coefficient of water. The gray matter did not have a clear dependence of conductivity on direction. In some regions in the white matter such as the internal capsule and the corpus callosum, conductivity exhibited high anisotropy. This method has potential applications in current source estimations of electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG).

TI Mathematical analyses in the study of electroencephalographic signals
SO REVISTA DE NEUROLOGIA
AB Aim. The principal mathematical techniques applied to the EEG are reviewed. Development. After the introduction of digital EEG, new mathematical tools have been developed for the EEG analysis. Nowadays there are several techniques that analyse the EEG signal in different ways, getting a better understanding of the EEG: development of nest, montages; artifact removal; analysis in time domain, phase coherence and synchrony; source analysis; epileptic seizures detection and prediction; superposition of electrical activity and other neuroimaging techniques. Although they have demonstrated their efficacy, the comparison between them is not always easy. Conclusions. The development of mathematical tools for EEG analysis has improved the knowledge of the electric cerebral activity in normal and pathological conditions. They study many different aspects of the EEG signal. Their continuous development will produce an increase the knowledge of the normal and pathological cerebral functions.

TI On the estimation of the number of dipole sources in EEG source
   localization
SO CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB Objective: The purpose of the present study was to determine the number of the equivalent dipole sources corresponding to the scalp EEG using the information criterion method based on the instantaneous-state modeling.
   Methods: A three-concentric-spheres head model was used to represent the head volume conductor. The Powell algorithm was used to solve the inverse problem of estimating the equivalent dipoles from the scalp EEG. The information criterion with different penalty functions was used to determine the dipole number. Computer simulations were conducted to evaluate effects of various parameters on the estimation of dipole number.
   Results: The present results suggest that the present method is able to estimate the number of equivalent current dipoles (ECDs) from instantaneous scalp EEG measurements, and that increase in the electrode number can improve the accuracy of estimation of the ECD number. For two ECDs, the best performance of estimation with 20% white noise were 85%, 92% and 94%, when 64, 128 and 256 electrodes are used, respectively. When there are 3 ECDs, the present results suggest that using 256 electrodes gave up to 82% estimation accuracy. The present simulation results also indicate that the accuracies of identification are similar when the minimum distance between dipoles is either 1 or 2 cm, which was used in the simulation. It was also found that the different penalty functions used in the information criterion method could have substantial influence on the estimation accuracy.
   Conclusions: The present method can estimate the number of ECDs from instantaneous scalp EEG distribution for up to three dipoles.
   Significance: The successful estimation of the number of ECDs will play an important role in expanding the applicability of dipole source localization to multiple sources. (c) 2005 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Simultaneous estimation and testing of sources in multiple MEG data sets
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING
AB The proposed Extended Couple Dipole Model (ECDM) is a trilinear component model that can be used to analyze multiple, related MEG data sets simultaneously. Related MEG data sets are data sets that contain activity of the same sources or activity of sources that have proportional source amplitudes. The simultaneous model uses a set of common sources and a set of common source time functions (wave shapes) to model the measured data in each data set. The set of common sources contains all sources that are active in at least one of the data sets to be analyzed. The number of common spatial and temporal components is specified by the user. The model for each data set is a linear combination of these common spatial and temporal components. This linear combination is estimated in a coupling matrix. Unlike the Coupled Dipole Model, where the user selects certain entries of the coupling matrix to be zero, the entire coupling matrix is estimated in the ECDM. This yields a more objective and statistically transparent estimation method, of which the identifiability constraints do not depend on the user's chosen design as in the CDM. Cramer-Rao Bounds are derived for the ECDM, and the significance of the estimated source activity is computed and illustrated by confidence regions around estimated source time functions.

TI Wavelet neural network classification of EEG signals by using AR model
   with MLE preprocessing
SO NEURAL NETWORKS
AB Since EEG is one of the most important sources of information in therapy of epilepsy, several researchers tried to address the issue of decision support for such a data. In this paper, we introduce two fundamentally different approaches for designing classification models (classifiers); the traditional statistical method based on logistic regression and the emerging computationally powerful techniques based on artificial neural networks (ANNs). Logistic regression as well as feedforward error backpropagation artificial neural networks (FEBANN) and wavelet neural networks (WNN) based classifiers were developed and compared in relation to their accuracy in classification of EEG signals. In these methods we used FFT and autoregressive (AR) model by using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of EEG signals as an input to classification system with two discrete outputs: epileptic seizure or nonepileptic seizure. By identifying features in the signal we want to provide an automatic system that will support a physician in the diagnosing process. By applying AR with MLE in connection with WNN, we obtained novel and reliable classifier architecture. The network is constructed by the error backpropagation neural network using Morlet mother wavelet basic function as node activation function. The comparisons between the developed classifiers were primarily based on analysis of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves as well as a number of scalar performance measures pertaining to the classification. The WNN-based classifier outperformed the FEBANN and logistic regression based counterpart. Within the same group, the WNN-based classifier was more accurate than the FEBANN-based classifier, and the logistic regression-based classifier. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Hidden Markov modelling of spike propagation from interictal MEG data
SO PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
AB For patients with partial epilepsy, automatic spike detection techniques applied to interictal MEG data often discover several potentially epileptogenic brain regions. An important determination in treatment planning is which of these detected regions are most likely to be the primary sources of epileptogenic activity. Analysis of the patterns of propagation activity between the detected regions may allow for detection of these primary epileptic foci. We describe the use of hidden Markov models (HMM) for estimation of the propagation patterns between several spiking regions from interictal MEG data. Analysis of the estimated transition probability matrix allows us to make inferences regarding the propagation pattern of the abnormal activity and determine the most likely region of its origin. The proposed HMM paradigm allows for a simple incorporation of the spike detector specificity and sensitivity characteristics. We develop bounds on performance for the case of perfect detection. We also apply the technique to simulated data sets in order to study the robustness of the method to the non-ideal specificity-sensitivity characteristics of the event detectors and compare results with the lower bounds. Our study demonstrates robustness of the proposed technique to event detection errors. We conclude with an example of the application of this method to a single patient.

TI Stimulus sequence affects schizophrenia - normal differences in event
   processing during an auditory oddball task
SO COGNITIVE BRAIN RESEARCH
AB Schizophrenia patients have difficulty distinguishing relevant from irrelevant auditory information. Auditory oddball paradigms are commonly used to investigate the processing of stimulus relevance. The present study used dense-array EEG and distributed source reconstructions to examine schizophrenia-normal differences in the processing of targets and standards as a function of the temporal sequence of stimuli. Brain responses were evaluated separately for early and late standards (standards 1-3 and 4-6 following a target, respectively) and early and late targets (those following 2-3 standards and 4-6 standards, respectively). The latencies of peaks (N1, P2, P3) in the event-related potential (ERP) waveforms did not differ between schizophrenia and normal subjects. However, schizophrenia-normal differences in neural activity, derived from minimum norm estimation, occurred at specific times during stimulus processing as a function of stimulus sequence. Schizophrenia patients displayed smaller activity than normals in early ERPs (left hemispheric N1, right frontal P2) to late targets, and they produced P3-like responses to late standards. Furthermore, during the P2/N2 time interval, opposite patterns of brain activity were elicited in schizophrenia and normal subjects in response to standards, indicating different neural responses to the same stimulus events. These results suggest attention allocation to task-irrelevant stimuli in schizophrenia, consequent upon insufficient representation of stimulus significance and context. Thus, schizophrenia compromises the ability to properly use context to solve even simple cognitive problems. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Independent Components Analysis (ICA) in the study of
   electroencephalographic signals
SO NEUROLOGIA
AB Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a mathematical tool able to separate complex signals in statistically independent components. It solves the blind source separation problem (BSS). The EEG satisfies most of the assumptions of ICA, so it may be an adequate signal for ICA for its use. In this paper we review the method and the applications of ICA in EEG. The studied applications are: a) artifacts removal; b) source estimation of spikes; c) analysis of seizures. Several studies have demonstrated that ICA is useful to remove artifacts from contaminated EEG records without distorting cerebral activity. It is able to decompose epileptic discharges and seizures in independent spatio-temporal components. In combination with techniques of source localisation, as dipole modelling, ICA improves the localization of the epileptic focus. Finally, we discuss the future role of ICA in the study of epileptic patients.

Bezruchko, Phys. Rev. E 68, 046209 (2003)] are widely applicable. Namely, although the expressions for the estimators and their confidence bands are derived for linear uncoupled oscillators under the influence of independent sources of Gaussian white noise, they turn out to allow reliable characterization of coupling from relatively short time series for different properties of noise, significant phase nonlinearity of the oscillators, and nonvanishing coupling between them. We apply the estimators to analyze a two-channel human intracranial epileptic electroencephalogram (EEG) recording with the purpose of epileptic focus localization.

TI Knowing good from bad: differential activation of human cortical areas
   by positive and negative outcomes
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE
AB Previous research has identified a component of the event-related brain potential (ERP), the feedback-related negativity, that is elicited by feedback stimuli associated with unfavourable outcomes. In the present research we used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings to test the common hypothesis that this component is generated in the caudal anterior cingulate cortex. The EEG results indicated that our paradigm, a time estimation task with trial-to-trial performance feedback, elicited a large feedback-related negativity (FRN). Nevertheless, the fMRI results did not reveal any area in the caudal anterior cingulate cortex that was differentially activated by positive and negative performance feedback, casting doubt on the notion that the FRN is generated in this brain region. In contrast, we found a number of brain areas outside the posterior medial frontal cortex that were activated more strongly by positive feedback than by negative feedback. These included areas in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, right superior frontal gyrus, and striatum. An anatomically constrained source model assuming equivalent dipole generators in the rostral anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, and right superior frontal gyrus produced a simulated scalp distribution that corresponded closely to the observed scalp distribution of the FRN. These results support a new hypothesis regarding the neural generators of the FRN, and have important implications for the use of this component as an electrophysiological index of performance monitoring and reward processing.

TI Bayesian solutions and performance analysis in bioelectric inverse
   problems
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB In bioelectric inverse problems, one seeks to recover bioelectric sources from remote measurements using a mathematical model that relates the sources to the measurements. Due to attenuation and spatial smoothing in the medium between the sources and the measurements, bioelectric inverse problems are generally ill-posed. Bayesian methodology has received increasing attention recently to combat this ill-posedness, since it offers a general formulation of regularization constraints and additionally provides statistical performance analysis tools. These tools include the estimation error covariance and the marginal probability density of the measurements (known as the "evidence") that allow one to predictively quantify and compare experimental designs. These performance analysis tools have been previously applied in inverse electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography, but only in relatively simple scenarios. The main motivation here was to extend the utility of Bayesian estimation techniques and performance analysis tools in bioelectric inverse problems, with a particular focus on electrocardiography. In a simulation study we first investigated whether Bayesian error covariance, computed without knowledge of the true sources and based on instead statistical assumptions, accurately predicted the actual reconstruction error. Our study showed that error variance was a reasonably reliable qualitative and quantitative predictor of estimation performance even when there was error in the prior model. We also examined whether the evidence statistic accurately predicted relative estimation performance when distinct priors were used. In a simple scenario our results support the hypothesis that the prior model that maximizes the evidence is a good choice for inverse reconstructions.

TI Line-source modeling and estimation with magnetoencephalography
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB We propose a number of source models that are spatially distributed on a line for magnetoencephalography (MEG) using both a spherical head with radial sensors for more efficient computation and a realistic head model for more accurate results. We develop these models with increasing degrees of freedom, derive forward solutions, maximum-likelihood (ML) estimates, and Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) expressions for the unknown source parameters. A model selection method is applied to select the most appropriate model. We also present numerical examples to compare the performances and computational costs of the different models, to determine the regions where better estimates are possible and when it is possible to distinguish between line and focal sources. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed line-source models over the previously available focal source model in certain distributed source cases. Finally, we apply our methods to real MEG data, the N20 response after electric stimulation of the median nerve known to be an extended source.

AB Different cortical source localization methods have been developed to directly link the scalp potentials with the cortical activities. Up to now, these methods are the only possible solution to noninvasively investigate cortical activities with both high spatial and time resolutions. However, the application of these methods is hindered by the fact that they have not been rigorously evaluated nor compared. In this paper, the performances of several source localization methods (moving dipoles, minimum Lp norm, and low resolution tomography (LRT) with Lp norm, p equal to 1, 1.5, and 2) were evaluated by using simulated scalp EEG data, scalp somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs), and upper limb motor-related potentials (MRPs) obtained on human subjects (all with 163 scalp electrodes). By using simulated EEG data, we first evaluated the source localization ability of the above methods quantitatively. Subsequently, the performance of the various methods was evaluated qualitatively by using experimental SEPs and MRPs. Our results show that the overall LRT Lp norm method with p equal to I has a better source localization ability than any of the other investigated methods and provides physiologically meaningful reconstruction results. Our evaluation results provide useful information for choosing cortical source localization approaches for future EEG/MEG studies. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Distinguishing between moving and stationary sources using EEG/MEG
   measurements with an application to epilepsy
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB Performances of electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) source estimation methods depend on the validity of the assumed model. In many cases, the model structure is related to physical information. We discuss a number of statistical selection methods to distinguish between two possible models using least-squares estimation and assuming a spherical head model. The first model has a single moving source whereas the second has two stationary sources; these may result in similar EEG/MEG measurements. The need to decide between such models occurs for example in Jacksonian seizures (e.g., epilepsy) or in intralobular activities, where a model with either two stationary dipole sources or a single moving dipole source may be possible. We also show that all of the selection methods discussed choose the correct model with probability one when the number of trials goes to infinity. Finally we present numerical examples and compare the performances of the methods by varying parameters such as the signal-to-noise ratio, source depth, and separation of sources, and also apply the methods to real MEG data for epilepsy.

TI Estimation of in vivo human brain-to-skull conductivity ratio from
   simultaneous extra- and intra-cranial electrical potential recordings
SO CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB Objective: The present study aims to accurately estimate the in vivo brain-to-skull conductivity ratio by means of cortical imaging technique. Simultaneous extra- and intra-cranial potential recordings induced by subdural current stimulation were analyzed to get the estimation.
   Methods: The effective brain-to-skull conductivity ratio was estimated in vivo for 5 epilepsy patients. The estimation was performed using multi-channel simultaneously recorded scalp and cortical electrical potentials during subdural electrical stimulation. The cortical imaging technique was used to compute the inverse cortical potential distribution from the scalp recorded potentials using a 3-shell head volume conductor model. The brain-to-skull conductivity ratio, which leads to the most consistent cortical potential estimates with respect to the direct intra-cranial measurements, is considered to be the effective brain-to-skull conductivity ratio.
   Results: The present estimation provided consistent results in 5 human subjects studied. The in vivo effective brain-to-skull conductivity ratio ranged from 18 to 34 in the 5 epilepsy patients.
   Conclusions: The effective brain-to-skull conductivity ratio can be estimated from simultaneous intra- and extra-cranial potential recordings and the averaged value/standard deviation is 25 +/- 7.
   Significance: The present results provide important experimental data on the brain-to-skull conductivity ratio, which is of significance for accurate brain source localization using piece-wise homogeneous head models.

TI Spatial enhancement of EEG traces by surface Laplacian estimation:
   comparison between local and global methods
SO CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB Objective: Surface Laplacian estimation enhances EEG spatial resolution. In this paper, we compare, on empirical grounds, two cornputationally different estimations of the surface Laplacian.
   Methods: Surface Laplacian was estimated from the same monopolar data set with both Hjorth's method [local; Electroenceph Clin Neurophysiol 39 (1975) 526] as modified by MacKay [Electroenceph Clin Neurophysiol 56 (1983) 696] and with spherical spline interpolation [global; Electroenceph Clin Neurophysiol 72 (1989) 184].
   Results: The grand averages computed with the two methods proved to be very similar but differed markedly from the monopolar ones. The two different computations were highly correlated, presented low relative errors and allowed to evidence comparable experimental effects.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that Hjorth's method and spherical spline interpolation convey similar topographic and chronometric informations.
   Significance: We provide empirical evidence that local and global methods of surface Laplacian estimation are equivalent to improve the spatial resolution of EEG traces. Global methods allow to explore the scalp topography and local methods allow to spare time in electrode setting that can be useful for studies on special populations (i.e. children, aged subjects) and for clinical purposes.

Eng. 51 (1) (2004) 45-55] we proposed to analyze cross-spectrum matrices obtained from electro- or magnetoencephalographic (EEG[MEG) signals, to obtain estimates of the EEG/MEG sources and their coherence. In this paper we extend this method in two ways. First, by modelling such interactions as linear filters, and second, by taking the mean of the signals across different trials into account. To obtain estimates we propose a stochastic maximum likelihood (SML) method, and obtain the concentrated likelihood that includes the trial means. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Estimation of the cortical functional connectivity with the multimodal
   integration of high-resolution EEG and fMRI data by directed transfer
   function
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB Nowadays, several types of brain imaging device are available to provide images of the functional activity of the cerebral cortex based on hemodynamic, metabolic, or electromagnetic measurements. However, static images of brain regions activated during particular tasks do not convey the information of how these regions communicate with each other. In this study, advanced methods for the estimation of cortical connectivity from combined high-resolution electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data are presented. These methods include a subject's multicompartment head model (scalp, skull, dura mater, cortex) constructed from individual magnetic resonance images, multidipole source model, and regularized linear inverse source estimates of cortical current density. Determination of the priors in the resolution of the linear inverse problem was performed with the use of information from the hemodynamic responses of the cortical areas as revealed by block-designed (strength of activated voxels) fMRI. We estimate functional cortical connectivity by computing the directed transfer function (DTF) on the estimated cortical current density waveforms in regions of interest (ROIs) on the modeled cortical mantle. The proposed method was able to unveil the direction of the information flow between the cortical regions of interest, as it is directional in nature. Furthermore, this method allows to detect changes in the time course of information flow between cortical regions in different frequency bands. The reliability of these techniques was further demonstrated by elaboration of high-resolution EEG and fMRI signals collected during visually triggered finger movements in four healthy subjects. Connectivity patterns estimated for this task reveal an involvement of right parietal and bilateral premotor and prefrontal cortical areas. This cortical region involvement resembles that revealed in previous studies where visually triggered finger movements were analyzed with the use of separate EEG or fMRI measurements.

TI Estimating brain conductivities and dipole source signals with EEG
   arrays
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB Techniques based on electroencephalography (EEG) measure the electric potentials on the scalp and process them to infer the location, distribution, and intensity of underlying neural activity. Accuracy in estimating these parameters is highly sensitive to uncertainty in the conductivities of the head tissues. Furthermore, dissimilarities among individuals are ignored when standarized values are used. In this paper, we apply the maximum-likelihood and maximum a posteriori (MAP) techniques to simultaneously estimate the layer conductivity ratios and source signal using EEG data. We use the classical 4-sphere model to approximate the head geometry, and assume a known dipole source position. The accuracy of our estimates is evaluated by comparing their standard deviations with the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB). The applicability of these techniques is illustrated with numerical examples on simulated EEG data. Our results show that the estimates have low bias and attain the CRB for sufficiently large number of experiments. We also present numerical examples evaluating the sensitivity to imprecise assumptions on the source position and skull thickness. Finally, we propose extensions to the case of unknown source position and present examples for real data.

AB Different brain imaging devices are presently available to provide images of the human functional cortical activity, based on hemodynamic, metabolic or electromagnetic measurements. However, static images of brain regions activated during particular tasks do not convey the information of how these regions are interconnected. The concept of brain connectivity plays a central role in the neuroscience, and different definitions of connectivity, functional and effective, have been adopted in literature. While the functional connectivity is defined as the temporal coherence among the activities of different brain areas, the effective connectivity is defined as the simplest brain circuit that would produce the same temporal relationship as observed experimentally among cortical sites. The structural equation modeling (SEM) is the most used method to estimate effective connectivity in neuroscience, and its typical application is on data related to brain hemodynarnic behavior tested by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), whereas the directed transfer function (DTF) method is a frequency-domain approach based on both a multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) modeling of time series and on the concept of Granger causality.
   This study presents advanced methods for the estimation of cortical connectivity by applying SEM and DTF on the cortical signals estimated from high-resolution electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, since these signals exhibit a higher spatial resolution than conventional cerebral electromagnetic measures. To estimate correctly the cortical signals, we used a subject's multicompartment head model (scalp, skull, dura mater, cortex) constructed from individual MRI, a distributed source model and a regularized linear inverse source estimates of cortical current density. Before the application of SEM and DTF methodology to the cortical waveforms estimated from high-esolution EEG data, we performed a simulation study, in which different main factors (signal-to-noise ratio, SNR, and simulated cortical activity duration, LENGTH) were systematically manipulated in the generation of test signals, and the errors in the estimated connectivity were evaluated by the analysis of variance (ANOVA). The statistical analysis returned that during simulations, both SEM and DTF estimators were able to correctly estimate the imposed connectivity pattems under reasonable operative conditions, that is, when data exhibit an SNR of at least 3 and a LENGTH of at least 75 s of nonconsecutive EEG recordings at 64 Hz of sampling rate. Hence, effective and functional connectivity patterns of cortical activity can be effectively estimated under general conditions met in any practical EEG recordings, by combining high-resolution EEG techniques and linear inverse estimation with SEM or DTF methods. We conclude that the estimation of cortical connectivity can be perfomed not only with hemodynamic measurements, but also with EEG signals treated with advanced computational techniques.

TI Hierarchical Bayesian estimation for MEG inverse
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB Source current estimation from MEG measurement is an ill-posed problem that requires prior assumptions about brain activity and an efficient estimation algorithm. In this article, we propose a new hierarchical Bayesian method introducing a hierarchical prior that can effectively incorporate both structural and functional MRI data. In our method, the variance of the source current at each source location is considered an unknown parameter and estimated from the observed MEG data and prior information by using the Variational Bayesian method. The fMRI information can be imposed as prior information on the variance distribution rather than the variance itself so that it gives a soft constraint on the variance. A spatial smoothness constraint, that the neural activity within a few millimeter radius tends to be similar due to the neural connections, can also be implemented as a hierarchical prior. The proposed method provides a unified theory to deal with the following three situations: (1) MEG with no other data, (2) MEG with structural MRI data on cortical surfaces, and (3) MEG with both structural MRI and fMRI data. We investigated the performance of our method and conventional linear inverse methods under these three conditions. Simulation results indicate that our method has better accuracy and spatial resolution than the conventional linear inverse methods under all three conditions. It is also shown that accuracy of our method improves as MRI and fMRI information becomes available. Simulation results demonstrate that our method appropriately resolves the inverse problem even if fMRI data convey inaccurate information, while the Wiener filter method is seriously deteriorated by inaccurate fMRI information.

TI EEG source imaging
SO CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB Objective: Electroencephalography (EEG) is an important tool for studying the temporal dynamics of the human brain's large-scale neuronal circuits. However, most EEG applications fail to capitalize on all of the data's available information, particularly that concerning the location of active sources in the brain. Localizing the sources of a given scalp measurement is only achieved by solving the so-called inverse problem. By introducing reasonable a priori constraints, the inverse problem can be solved and the most probable sources in the brain at every moment in time can be accurately localized.
   Methods and Results: Here, we review the different EEG source localization procedures applied during the last two decades. Additionally, we detail the importance of those procedures preceding and following source estimation that are intimately linked to a successful, reliable result. We discuss (1) the number and positioning of electrodes, (2) the varieties of inverse solution models and algorithms, (3) the integration of EEG source estimations with MRI data, (4) the integration of time and frequency in source imaging, and (5) the statistical analysis of inverse solution results.
   Conclusions and Significance: We show that modern EEG source imaging simultaneously details the temporal and spatial dimensions of brain activity, making it an important and affordable tool to study the properties of cerebral, neural networks in cognitive and clinical neurosciences.

TI What is common to brain activity evoked by the perception of visual and
   auditory filled durations? A study with MEG and EEG co-recordings
SO COGNITIVE BRAIN RESEARCH
AB EEG and MEG scalp data were simultaneously recorded while human participants were performing a duration discrimination task in visual and auditory modality, separately. Short durations were used ranging from 500 to 900 ms, among which participants had to discriminate a previously memorized 700-ms "standard" duration. Behavioral results show accurate but variable performance within and between participants with expected modality effects: the percentage of responses was greater and the mean response time was shorter for auditory than for visual signals. Sustained electric and magnetic activities were obtained correlatively to duration estimation, but with distinct spatiotemporal properties. Electric CNV-Iike potentials showed fronto-central negativity in both modalities, whereas magnetic sustained fields were distributed with respect to the modality of the interval to be timed. Time courses of these slow brain activities were found to be dependent on stimulus duration but not on its modality nor on the recording signal (EEG or MEG). Source reconstruction demonstrated that these sustained potentials/fields were generated by superimposed contributions from visual and auditory cortices (sustained sensory responses, SSR) and from prefrontal and parietal regions. By using these two complementary techniques, we thus demonstrated the involvement of frontal and parietal cerebral cortex in human timing. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

TI A recursive algorithm for the three-dimensional imaging of brain
   electric activity: Shrinking LORETA-FOCUSS
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB Estimation of intracranial electric activity from the scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) requires a solution to the EEG inverse problem, which is known as an ill-conditioned problem. In order to yield a unique solution, weighted minimum norm least square (MNLS) inverse methods are generally used. This paper proposes a recursive algorithm, termed Shrinking LORETA-FOCUSS, which combines and expands upon the central features of two well-known weighted MNLS methods: LORETA and FOCUSS. This recursive algorithm makes iterative adjustments to the solution space as well as the weighting matrix, thereby dramatically reducing the computation load, and increasing local source resolution. Simulations are conducted on a 3-shell spherical head model registered to the Talairach human brain atlas. A comparative study of four different inverse methods, standard Weighted Minimum Norm, L1-norm, LORETA-FOCUSS and Shrinking LORETA-FOCUSS are presented. The results demonstrate that Shrinking LORETA-FOCUSS is able to reconstruct a three-dimensional source distribution with smaller localization and energy errors compared to the other methods.

TI Blind source separation via generalized Eigenvalue decomposition
SO JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH
AB In this short note we highlight the fact that linear blind source separation can be formulated as a generalized eigenvalue decomposition under the assumptions of non-Gaussian, non-stationary, or non-white independent sources. The solution for the unmixing matrix is given by the generalized eigenvectors that simultaneously diagonalize the covariance matrix of the observations and an additional symmetric matrix whose form depends upon the particular assumptions. The method critically determines the mixture coefficients and is therefore not robust to estimation errors. However it provides a rather general and unified solution that summarizes the conditions for successful blind source separation. To demonstrate the method, which can be implemented in two lines of matlab code, we present results for artificial mixtures of speech and real mixtures of electroencephalography (EEG) data, showing that the same sources are recovered under the various assumptions.

TI Overlearning in marginal distribution-based ICA: Analysis and solutions
SO JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH
AB The present paper is written as a word of caution, with users of independent component analysis (ICA) in mind, to overlearning phenomena that are often observed.
   We consider two types of overlearning, typical to high-order statistics based ICA. These algorithms can be seen to maximise the negentropy of the source estimates. The first kind of overlearning results in the generation of spike-like signals, if there are not enough samples in the data or there is a considerable amount of noise present. It is argued that, if the data has power spectrum characterised by 1/f curve, we face a more severe problem, which cannot be solved inside the strict ICA model. This overlearning is better characterised by bumps instead of spikes. Both overlearning types are demonstrated in the case of artificial signals as well as magnetoencephalograms (MEG). Several methods are suggested to circumvent both types, either by making the estimation of the ICA model more robust or by including further modelling of the data.

TI Spectral spatiotemporal imaging of cortical oscillations and
   interactions in the human brain
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB This paper presents a computationally efficient source estimation algorithm that localizes cortical oscillations and their phase relationships. The proposed method employs wavelet-transformed magnetoencephalography (MEG) data and uses anatomical MRI to constrain the current locations to the cortical mantle. In addition, the locations of the sources can be further confined with the help of functional MRI (fMRI) data. As a result, we obtain spatiotemporal maps of spectral power and phase relationships. As an example, we show how the phase locking value (PLV), that is, the trial-by-trial phase relationship between the stimulus and response, can be imaged on the cortex. We apply the method to spontaneous, evoked, and driven cortical oscillations measured with MEG. We test the method of combining MEG, structural MRI, and fMRI using simulated cortical oscillations along Heschl's gyrus (HG). We also analyze sustained auditory gamma-band neuromagnetic fields from MEG and fMRI measurements. Our results show that combining the MEG recording with fMRI improves source localization for the non-noise-normalized wavelet power. In contrast, noise-normalized spectral power or PLV localization may not benefit from the fMRI constraint. We show that if the thresholds are not properly chosen, noise-normalized spectral power or PLV estimates may contain false (phantom) sources, independent of the inclusion of the fMRI prior information. The proposed algorithm can be used for evoked MEG/EEG and block-designed or event-related fMRI paradigms, or for spontaneous MEG data sets. Spectral spatiotemporal imaging of cortical oscillations and interactions in the human brain can provide further understanding of large-scale neural activity and communication between different brain regions.

TI Analysis of sparse representation and blind source separation
SO NEURAL COMPUTATION
AB In this letter, we analyze a two-stage cluster-then-l(1)-optimization approach for sparse representation of a data matrix, which is also a promising approach for blind source separation (BSS) in which fewer sensors than sources are present. First, sparse representation (factorization) of a data matrix is discussed. For a given overcomplete basis matrix, the corresponding sparse solution (coefficient matrix) with minimum l(1) norm is unique with probability one, which can be obtained using a standard linear programming algorithm. The equivalence of the l(1)-norm solution and the l(0)-norm solution is also analyzed according to a probabilistic framework. If the obtained l(1)-norm solution is sufficiently sparse, then it is equal to the l(0)-norm solution with a high probability. Furthermore, the l(1)-norm solution is robust to noise, but the l(0)-norm solution is not, showing that the l(1)-norm is a good sparsity measure. These results can be used as a recoverability analysis of BSS, as discussed. The basis matrix in this article is estimated using a clustering algorithm followed by normalization, in which the matrix columns are the cluster centers of normalized data column vectors. Zibulevsky, Pearlmutter, Boll, and Kisilev (2000) used this kind of two-stage approach in underdetermined BSS. Our recoverability analysis shows that this approach can deal with the situation in which the sources are overlapped to some degree in the analyzed domain and with the case in which the source number is unknown. It is also robust to additive noise and estimation error in the mixing matrix. Finally, four simulation examples and an EEG data analysis example are presented to illustrate the algorithm's utility and demonstrate its performance.

TI Localization of realistic cortical activity in MEG using current
   multipoles
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB We present a novel approach to MEG source estimation based on a regularized first-order multipole solution. The Gaussian regularizing prior is obtained by calculation of the sample mean and covariance matrix for the equivalent moments of realistic simulated cortical activity. We compare the regularized multipole localization framework to the classical dipole and general multipole source estimation methods by evaluating the ability of all three solutions to localize the centroids of physiologically plausible patches of activity simulated on the surface of a human cerebral cortex. The results, obtained with a realistic sensor configuration, a spherical head model, and given in terms of field and localization error, depict the performance of the dipolar and multipolar models as a function of variable source surface area (50-500 mm(2)), noise conditions (20, 10, and 5 dB SNR), source orientation (0-90degrees), and source depth (3-11 cm). We show that as the sources increase in size, they become less accurately modeled as current dipoles. The regularized multipole systematically outperforms the single dipole model, increasingly so as the spatial extent of the sources increases. In addition, our simulations demonstrate that as the orientation of the sources becomes more radial, dipole localization accuracy decreases substantially, while the performance of the regularized multipole model is far less sensitive to orientation and even succeeds in localizing quasiradial source configurations. Furthermore, our results show that the multipole model is able to localize superficial sources with higher accuracy than the current dipole. These results indicate that the regularized multipole solution may be an attractive alternative to current-dipole-based source estimation methods in MEG. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Use of a priori information in estimating tissue resistivities -
   application to human data in vivo
SO PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT
AB Accurate resistivity values are necessary to construct reliable numerical models to solve forward/inverse problems in EEG and to localize activity centres in functional brain imaging. These models require accurate geometry and resistivity distribution. The geometry may be extracted from high resolution images. The resistivity distribution may be estimated by using a statistically constrained minimum mean squared error estimator algorithm that has been developed previously by Baysal and Eyuboglu. In this study, the data are obtained by EEG and MEG sensors during SEF/SEP experiments that involve nine human subjects. The numerical model is realistic, subject-specific and the scalp, the skull and the brain resistivities are estimated. By performing nine different estimations, we found average resistivities of 3.183, 64.559 and 2.833 Omega m for scalp, skull and brain, respectively, all under 9% standard deviation. The discrepancies between these results and other works are discussed in detail.

TI Noise-free magnetoencephalography recordings of brain function
SO PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
AB Perhaps the greatest impediment to acquiring high-quality magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings is the ubiquitous ambient magnetic field noise. We have designed and built a whole-head MEG system using a helmet-like superconducting imaging surface (SIS) surrounding the array of superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometers used to measure the MEG signal. We previously demonstrated that the SIS passively shields the SQUID array from ambient magnetic field noise, independent of frequency, by 25-60 dB depending on sensor location. SQUID 'reference sensors' located on the outside of the SIS helmet measure ambient magnetic fields in very close proximity to the MEG magnetometers while being nearly perfectly shielded from all sources in the brain. The fact that the reference sensors measure no brain signal yet are located in close proximity to the MEG sensors enables very accurate estimation and subtraction of the ambient field noise contribution to the MEG sensors using an adaptive algorithm. We have demonstrated total ambient noise reduction factors in excess of 10(6) (> 120 dB). The residual noise for most MEG SQUID channels is at or near the intrinsic SQUID noise floor, typically 2-3 fT Hz(-1/2). We are recording MEG signals with greater signal-to-noise than equivalent EEG measurements.

TI Multimodal integration of EEG and MEG data: A simulation study with
   variable signal-to-noise ratio and number of sensors
SO HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING
AB Previous simulation studies have stressed the importance of the multimodal integration of electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) data in the estimation of cortical current density. In such studies, no systematic variations of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and of the number of sensors were explicitly taken into account in the estimation process. We investigated effects of variable SNR and number of sensors on the accuracy of current density estimate by using multimodal EEG and MEG data. This was done by using as the dependent variable both the correlation coefficient (CC) and the relative error (RE) between imposed and estimated waveforms at the level of cortical region of interests (ROI). A realistic head and cortical surface model was used. Factors used in the simulations were: (1) the SNR of the simulated scalp data (with seven levels: infinite, 30, 20, 10, 5, 3, 1); (2) the particular inverse operator used to estimate the cortical source activity from the simulated scalp data (131,INVERSE, with two levels, including minimum norm and weighted minimum norm); and (3) the number of EEG or MEG sensors employed in the analysis (SENSORS, with three levels: 128,61,29 for EEG and 153,61, or 38 in MEG). Analysis of variance demonstrated that all the considered factors significantly affect the CC and the RE indexes. Combined EEG-MEG data produced statistically significant lower RE and higher CC in source current density reconstructions compared to that estimated by the EEG and MEG data considered separately. These observations hold for the range of SNR values presented by the analyzed data. The superiority of current density estimation by multimodal integration of EEG and MEG was not due to differences in number of sensors between unimodal (EEG, MEG) and combined (EEG-MEG) inverse estimates. In fact, the current density estimate relative to the EEG-MEG multimodal integration involved 61 EEG plus 63 MEG sensors, whereas estimations carried out with the single modalities alone involved 128 sensors for EEG and 153 sensors for MEG. The results of the simulations also suggest that the use of simultaneous 29 EEG sensors during the MEG measurements carried out with full sensor arrangements (153 sensors) returned an accuracy of the cortical source estimate statistically similar to that obtained by combining 64 EEG and 153 MEG sensors.

TI Spatio-temporal cortical source imaging of brain electrical activity by
   means of time-varying parametric projection filter
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB In the present study, we explore suitable spatio-temporal filters for inverse estimation of an equivalent dipole-layer distribution from the scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) for imaging of brain electric sources. We propose a time-varying parametric projection filter (tPPF) for the spatio-temporal EEG analysis. The performance of this tPPF algorithm was evaluated by computer simulation studies. An inhomogeneous three-concentric-spheres model was used in the present simulation study to represent the head volume conductor. An equivalent dipole layer was used to represent equivalently brain electric sources and estimated from the scalp potentials. The tPPF filter was tested to remove time-varying noise such as instantaneous artifacts caused by eyes-blink. The present simulation results indicate that the proposed time-variant tPPF method provides enhanced performance in rejecting time-varying noise, as compared with the time-invariant parametric projection filter.

TI Recursive penalized least squares solution for dynamical inverse
   problems of EEG generation
SO HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING
AB In the dynamical inverse problem of electroencephalogram (EEG) generation where a specific dynamics for the electrical current distribution is assumed, we can impose general spatiotemporal constraints onto the solution by casting the problem into a state space representation and assuming a specific class of parametric models for the dynamics. The Akaike Bayesian Information Criterion (ABIC), which is based on the Type II likelihood, was used to estimate the parameters and evaluate the model. In addition, dynamic low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA), a new approach for estimating the current distribution is introduced. A recursive penalized least squares (RPLS) step forms the main element of our implementation. To obtain improved inverse solutions, dynamic LORETA exploits both spatial and temporal information, whereas LORETA uses only spatial information. A considerable improvement in performance compared to LORETA was found when dynamic LORETA was applied to simulated EEG data, and the new method was applied also to clinical EEG data.

TI Keep it simple: a case for using classical minimum norm estimation in
   the analysis of EEG and MEG data
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB The present study aims at finding the optimal inverse solution for the bioelectromagnetic inverse problem in the absence of reliable a priori information about the generating sources. Three approaches to tackle this problem are compared theoretically: the maximum-likelihood approach, the minimum norm approach, and the resolution optimization approach. It is shown that in all three of these frameworks, it is possible to make use of the same kind of a priori information if available, and the same solutions are obtained if the same a priori information is implemented. In particular, they all yield the minimum norm pseudoinverse (MNP) in the complete absence of such information. This indicates that the properties of the MNP, and in particular, its limitations like the inability to localize sources in depth, are not specific to this method but are fundamental limitations of the recording modalities. The minimum norm solution provides the amount of information that is actually present in the data themselves, and is therefore optimally suited to investigate the general resolution and accuracy limits of EEG and MEG measurement configurations. Furthermore, this strongly suggests that the classical minimum norm solution is a valuable method whenever no reliable a priori information about source generators is available, that is, when complex cognitive tasks are employed or when very noisy data (e.g., single-trial data) are analyzed. For that purpose, an efficient and practical implementation of this method will be suggested and illustrated with simulations using a realistic head geometry. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

TI Automated interictal spike detection and source localization in
   magnetoencephalography using independent components analysis and
   spatio-temporal clustering
SO CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB Objective: Magnetoencephalography (MEG) dipole localization of epileptic spikes is useful in epilepsy surgery for mapping the extent of abnormal cortex and to focus intracranial electrodes. Visually analyzing large amounts of data produces fatigue and error. Most automated techniques are based on matching of interictal spike templates or predictive filtering of the data and do not explicitly include source localization as part of the analysis. This leads to poor sensitivity versus specificity characteristics. We describe a fully automated method that combines time-series analysis with source localization to detect clusters of focal neuronal current generators within the brain that produce interictal spike activity.
   Methods: We first use an ICA (independent components analysis) method to decompose the multichannel MEG data and identify those components that exhibit spike-like characteristics. From these detected spikes we then find those whose spatial topographies across the array are consistent with focal neural sources, and determine the foci of equivalent current dipoles and their associated time courses. We then perform a clustering of the localized dipoles based on distance metrics that takes into consideration both their locations and time courses. The final step of refinement consists of retaining only those clusters that are statistically significant. The average locations and time series from significant clusters comprise the final output of our method.
   Results and Significance: Data were processed from 4 patients with partial focal epilepsy. In all three subjects for whom surgical resection was performed, clusters were found in the vicinity of the resectioned area.
   Conclusions: The presented procedure is promising and likely to be useful to the physician as a more sensitive, automated and objective method to help in the localization of the interictal spike zone of intractable partial seizures. The final output can be visually verified by neurologists in terms of both the location and distribution of the dipole clusters and their associated time series. Due to the clinical relevance and demonstrated promise of this method, further investigation of this approach is warranted. (C) 2004 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

TI EEG minimum-norm estimation compared with MEG dipole fitting in the
   localization of somatosensory sources at S1
SO CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB Objective: Dipole models, which are frequently used in attempts to solve the electromagnetic inverse problem, require explicit a priori assumptions about the cerebral current sources. This is not the case for solutions based on minimum-norm estimates. In the present study, we evaluated the spatial accuracy of the L2 minimum-norm estimate (MNE) in realistic noise conditions by assessing its ability to localize sources of evoked responses at the primary somatosensory cortex (SI).
   Methods: Multichannel somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) and magnetic fields (SEFs) were recorded in 5 subjects while stimulating the median and ulnar nerves at the left wrist. A Tikhonov-regularized L2-MNE, constructed on a spherical surface from the SEP signals, was compared with an equivalent current dipole (ECD) solution obtained from the SEFs.
   Results: Primarily tangential current sources accounted for both SEP and SEF distributions at around 20 ms (N20/N20m) and 70 ms (P70/P70m), which deflections were chosen for comparative analysis. The distances between the locations of the maximum current densities obtained from MNE and the locations of ECDs were on the average 12-13 mm for both deflections and nerves stimulated. In accordance with the somatotopical order of SI, both the MNE and ECD tended to localize median nerve activation more laterally than ulnar nerve activation for the N20/N20m deflection. Simulation experiments further indicated that, with a proper estimate of the source depth and with a good fit of the head model, the MNE can reach a mean accuracy of 5 mm in 0.2-RV root-mean-square noise.
   Conclusions: When compared with previously reported localizations based on dipole modelling of SEPs, it appears that equally accurate localization of S1 can be obtained with the MNE. Significance: MNE can be used to verify parametric source modelling results. Having a relatively good localization accuracy and requiring minimal assumptions, the MNE may be useful for the localization of poorly known activity distributions and for tracking activity changes between brain areas as a function of time.

TI Electrical neuroimaging based on biophysical constraints
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB This paper proposes and implements biophysical constraints to select a unique solution to the bioelectromagnetic inverse problem. It first shows that the brain's electric fields and potentials are predominantly due to ohmic currents. This serves to reformulate the inverse problem in terms of a restricted source model permitting noninvasive estimations of Local Field Potentials (LFPs) in depth from scalp-recorded data. Uniqueness in the solution is achieved by a physically derived regularization strategy that imposes a spatial structure on the solution based upon the physical laws that describe electromagnetic fields in biological media. The regularization strategy and the source model emulate the properties of brain activity's actual generators. This added information is independent of both the recorded data and head model and suffices for obtaining a unique solution compatible with and aimed at analyzing experimental data. The inverse solution's features are evaluated with event-related potentials (ERPs) from a healthy subject performing a visuo-motor task. Two aspects are addressed: the concordance between available neurophysiological evidence and inverse solution results, and the functional localization provided by fMRI data from the same subject under identical experimental conditions. The localization results are spatially and temporally concordant with experimental evidence, and the areas detected as functionally activated in both imaging modalities are similar, providing indices of localization accuracy. We conclude that biophysically driven inverse solutions offer a novel and reliable possibility for studying brain function with the temporal resolution required to advance our understanding of the brain's functional networks.

TI An alternative subspace approach to EEG dipole source localization
SO PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
AB In the present study, we investigate a new approach to electroencephalography (EEG) three-dimensional (3D) dipole source localization by using a non-recursive subspace algorithm called FINES. In estimating source dipole locations, the present approach employs projections onto a subspace spanned by a small set of particular vectors (FINES vector set) in the estimated noise-only subspace instead of the entire estimated noise-only subspace in the case of classic MUSIC. The subspace spanned by this vector set is, in the sense of principal angle, closest to the subspace spanned by the array manifold associated with a particular brain region. By incorporating knowledge of the array manifold in identifying FINES vector sets in the estimated noise-only subspace for different brain regions, the present approach is able to estimate sources with enhanced accuracy and spatial resolution, thus enhancing the capability of resolving closely spaced sources and reducing estimation errors, The present computer simulations show, in EEG 3D dipole source localization, that compared to classic MUSIC, FINES has (1) better resolvability of two closely spaced dipolar sources and (2) better estimation accuracy of source locations. In comparison with RAP-MUSIC, FINES' performance is also better for the cases studied when the noise level is high and/or correlations among dipole sources exist.

TI Frequency domain simultaneous source and source coherence estimation
   with an application to MEG
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB Interactions between cortical areas are crucial for cognitive functioning. Methods currently in use to assess such interactions are not well suited for this task because they lack timing precision, localization precision, or, both. We present a method for simultaneous estimation of source location and orientation parameters and cross-spectral parameters to overcome these problems. Different estimators are evaluated for their performance. From a simulation study, we conclude that the estimators derived from the maximum-likelihood procedure have good statistical properties with moderate sample sizes, whereas those obtained from the generalized least squares procedure are biased and give poor-quality standard errors. The method is illustrated with visually evoked field data, with inconclusive results.

TI EEG deblurring techniques in a clinical context
SO METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE
CT 4th International Workshop on Biosignal Interpretation (BSI2002)
CY JUN 24-26, 2002
CL Villa Olmo, ITALY
AB Objectives: EEG scalp potential distributions recorded in humans are affected by low spatial resolution and by the dependence on the electrical reference used. High resolution EEG technologies are available to drastically increase the spatial resolution of the raw EEG. Such technologies include the computation of surface Laplacian (SL) of the recorded potentials, as well as the use of realistic head models to estimate the cortical sources via linear inverse procedure (low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography, LORETA). However, these deblurring procedures are generally used in conjunction with EEG recordings with 64-128 scalp electrodes and with realistic head models obtained via sequential magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of the subjects. Such recording setup it is not often available in the clinical context, due to both the unavailability of these technologies and the scarce compliance of the patients with them. In this study we addressed the use of SL and LORETA deblurring techniques to analyze data from a standard 10-20 system (19 electrodes) in a group of Alzheimer disease (AD) patients.
   Methods: EEG data related to unilateral finger movements were gathered from 10 patients affected by AD. SL and LORETA techniques were applied for source estimation of EEG data. The use of MRIs for the construction of head models was avoided by using the quasi-realistic head model of the Brain Imaging Neurology Institute of Montreal.
   Results: A similar cortical activity estimated by the SL and LORETA techniques was observed during an identical time period of the acquired EEG data in the examined population.
   Conclusions: The results of the present study suggest that both SL and LORETA approaches can be usefully applied in the clinical context, by using quasi-realistic head modeling and a standard 10-20 system as electrode montage (19 electrodes). These results represent a reciprocal cross-validation of the two mathematically independent techniques in a clinical environment.

AB We survey the field of magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electro-encephalography (EEG) source estimation. These modalities offer the potential for functional brain mapping with temporal resolution in the millisecond range. However, the limited number of spatial measurements and the ill-posedness of the inverse problem present significant limits to our ability to produce accurate spatial maps from these data without imposing major restrictions on the form of the inverse solution. Here we describe approaches to solving the forward problem of computing the mapping from putative inverse solutions into the data space. We then describe the inverse problem in terms of low dimensional solutions, based on the equivalent current dipole (ECD), and high dimensional solutions, in which images of neural activation are constrained to the cerebral cortex. We also address the issue of objective assessment of the relative performance of inverse procedures by the free-response receiver operating characteristic (FROC) curve. We conclude with a discussion of methods for assessing statistical significance of experimental results through use of the bootstrap for determining confidence regions in dipole-fitting methods, and random field (RF) and permutation methods for detecting significant activation in cortically constrained imaging studies.

AB We survey the recent activities of the Odyssee Laboratory in the area of the application of mathematics to the design of models for studying brain anatomy and function. We start with the problem of reconstructing sources in MEG and EEG, and discuss the variational approach we have developed for solving these inverse problems. This motivates the need for geometric models of the head. We present a method for automatically and accurately extracting surface meshes of several tissues of the head from anatomical magnetic resonance (MR) images. Anatomical connectivity can be extracted from diffusion tensor magnetic resonance images but, in the current state of the technology, it must be preceded by a robust estimation and regularization stage. We discuss our work based on variational principles and show how the results can be used to track fibers in the white matter (WM) as geodesics in some Riemannian space. We then go to the statistical modeling of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals from the viewpoint of their decomposition in a pseudo-deterministic and stochastic part that we then use to perform clustering of voxels in a way that is inspired by the theory of support vector machines and in a way that is grounded in information theory. Multimocial image matching is discussed next in the framework of image statistics and partial differential equations (PDEs) with an eye on registering fMRI to the anatomy. The paper ends with a discussion of a new theory of random shapes that may prove useful in building anatomical and functional atlases. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: The present study was aimed at testing whether foreperiod duration affects the activity recorded over the primary sensorimotor cortices during the reaction time.
   Methods: The foreperiod duration (500 or 2500 ms) was varied across blocks of trials during a between-hand choice reaction time task; surface Laplacians were estimated from EEG recordings by the source derivation method.
   Results: Reaction time was shorter for the 500 ms foreperiod than for the 2500 ms foreperiod. A contralateral negativity/ipsilateral positivity pattern showed up over the primary sensorimotor cortices. The time between the contralateral negativity onset and the electromyographic onset was shorter for the 500 ms foreperiod than for the 2500 ms foreperiod, which suggests that the foreperiod affects the implementation of the motor command. Furthermore, the interval between the onset of the voluntary electromyographic activity and the mechanical response was shorter for the 500 ms foreperiod than for the 2500 ms foreperiod.
   Conclusions: These results indicate that time preparation affects both central and peripheral motor processes. (C) 2003 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Estimation of the number of EEG sources in the human brain using
   multidimensional directed information analysis
SO ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING IN JAPAN
AB At present, various approaches are being used to analyze brain function. One of these is the analysis of EEGs (electroencephalogram), by which it is becoming possible to evaluate brain activity and abnormalities in the brain from the EEG observed on the scalp. There remain many unknown aspects of the source of EEGs and their mechanism of propagation. A clue to such an approach is causality analysis, whose objective is to analyze causality by quantifying correlation relations, including the directions of information flow, among measurement sites, based on multiple EEG series obtained from multiple sites on the scalp. The method should be applicable to the diagnosis of disease such as the detection of individual abnormalities and failure of information propagation. Consequently, we have proposed multidimensional directed information analysis as a means of causality analysis in which the flow of information among all signals is investigated.
   There are many multidimensional signals in nature, for which the number of information flow sources in unknown. It is very important to discover the number of sources. Therefore, we propose a method to estimate the number of information flow sources by multidimensional directed information analysis. In this paper, the effectiveness of the proposed method has been verified by a simulation, and the method has been applied to the EEG of a healthy subject and a patient with a cerebral organic disorder. As a result, we have found that the healthy subject had six information flow sources and the patient had nine. (C) 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI ICA-based spatiotemporal approach for single-trial analysis of
   postmovement MEG beta synchronization
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB The extraction of event-related oscillatory neuromagnetic activities from single-trial measurement is challenging due to the non-phase-locked nature and variability from trial to trial. The present study presents a method based on independent component analysis (ICA) and the use of a template-based correlation approach to extract Rolandic beta rhythm from magnetoencephalographic (MEG) measurements of right finger lifting. A single trial recording was decomposed into a set of coupled temporal independent components and corresponding spatial maps using ICA and the reactive beta frequency band for each trial identified using a two-spectrum comparison between the postmovement interval and a reference period. Task-related components survived dual criteria of high correlation with both the temporal and the spatial templates with an acceptance rate of about 80%. Phase and amplitude information for noise-free MEG beta activities were preserved not only for optimal calculation of beta rebound (event-related synchronization) but also for profound penetration into subtle dynamics across trials. Given the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of this method, various methods of source estimation were used on reconstructed single-trial data and the source loci coherently anchored in the vicinity of the primary motor area. This method promises the possibility of a window into the intricate brain dynamics of motor control mechanisms and the cortical pathophysiology of movement disorder on a trial-by-trial basis.

TI The use of anatomical constraints with MEG beamformers
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB Synthetic Aperture Magnetometry (SAM) is a beamformer approach for the localisation of neuronal activity from EEG/MEG data. SAM estimates the optimum orientation of each source in a predefined source space by a nonlinear search for the orientation that maximises the beamformer output. However, MEG is most sensitive to cortical sources and these sources are generally oriented perpendicular to the surface. The reconstructed neuronal activity can therefore reasonably be constrained to the cortical surface, orientated perpendicular to it, therefore removing the search for the optimum orientation for the computation of the beamformer weights. This paper sets out to compare the performance of a constrained and unconstrained beamformer (SAM), with respect to the localisation accuracy of the source reconstructions and the spatial resolution. Fifty sources were randomly placed on a cortical surface estimated from an MRI, and we simulated data over a range of different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for each source. These datasets were analysed using both an unconstrained beamformer (SAM) and a constrained beamformer (with the sources orientated perpendicular to the cortical surface). The influence of errors in the estimation of the surface location and surface normals on the performance of the constrained beamformer, representing MEG/MRI coregistration and segmentation errors, were also examined. The spatial resolution of the beamformer improves, typically by a factor of four by applying anatomical constraints, and the localisation accuracy improves marginally. However, the advantage in spatial resolution disappears when errors are introduced into the orientation and location constraints, and, moreover, the localisation accuracy of the inaccurately constrained beamformer degrades rapidly. We conclude that the use of anatomical constraints is only advantageous if the MEG/MRI coregistration error is smaller than 2 ram and the error in the estimation of the cortical surface orientation is smaller than 10degrees.

TI The 3D topography of MEG source localization accuracy: effects of
   conductor model and noise
SO CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB Objective: To evaluate the effect that different head conductor models have on the source estimation accuracy of magnetoencephalography (MEG) under realistic conditions.
   Methods: Magnetic fields evoked by cur-rent dipoles were simulated using a highly refined 3-layer realistically shaped conductor model. Noise from a real MEG measurement was added to the simulated fields. Source parameters (location, strength, orientation) were estimated from the noisy signals using 3 spherically symmetric models and several one- and 3-layer realistically shaped boundary-element models. The effect of different measurement sensors (gradiometers, magnetometers) was also tested.
   Results: The noise typically present in brain signals masked the errors due to the different conductor models so that in most situations the models gave comparable results. Active cortical areas around the vertex and in the temporal, frontoparietal, and occipital regions were typically found with 2-4 min accuracy, whereas source localization in several anterior frontal lobe and deep brain structures yielded errors exceeding 2 cm. Localization in anterior frontal regions may benefit most from the use of realistically shaped models.
   Conclusions: The traditionally used sphere model is an adequate model for most research purposes. Any means that increase the signal-to-noise ratio are of highest importance in attempting to improve the source estimation accuracy. (C) 2003 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

TI The temporal prior in bioelectromagnetic source imaging problems
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB The multiplicity of temporal priors proposed for regularization of the bioelectromagnetic source imaging problems [e.g., the inverse electrocardiogram (ECG) and inverse electroencephalogram (EEG) problems], is discordant with the fact that fundamental statistical principles sharply limit the choice. Thus, our objective is to derive the form of the prior consistent with the general unavailability of temporal constraints. Writing linear formulations of the inverse ECG and inverse EEG problems as H = FG + N (where the ith columns of matrices H, G, and N, are data, signal, and noise vectors at time step i, and F is the transfer matrix), and using the noninformative principle that features of the spatiotemporal prior not supplied a posteriori should be invariant under temporal transformations, we show that the implied spatiotemporal signal autocovariance matrix (of the vector formed by the entries of G) is given in block matrix form as
   C-G = (epsilon[G'G] circle times epsilon[G'G])/(epsilon[parallel toGparallel to(2)]) = ((epsilon[H'H] - epsilon[N'N]) circle times C-g)/((F'F) circle dot C-g)
   where C-g is a matrix of unit trace proportional to the autocovariance matrix of any column of G (representing supplied information regarding the spatial prior), epsilon[(.)] denotes expectation, superscript ' indicates transpose, circle times is the Kronecker product, parallel to(.)parallel to is Frobenius norm, and the "matrix scalar product" circle dot indicates the inner product of the two vectors formed by the entries of the two adjacent matrices (i.e., A circle dot B drop trace[A'B]). This result eliminates some uncertainties and ambiguities that have characterized spatiotemporal regularization methods - including eight methods previously introduced in this transactions. Ultimately, the result derives from an implied symmetry principle under which the form of a nontrivial noninformative temporal component of the prior can be identified. Among other things, separability of the spatiotemporal prior in terms of the above Kronecker product can be thought of as the expression of the lack of "entanglement" of the spatial and temporal contributions (a consequence of noninformativity). The approach is generalized to the important cases of non-Gaussian spatial priors, and signal and noise that are not independent (transfer matrix noise). We also demonstrate a means for computational complexity reduction, related to the application of a particular orthogonal transformation, having features dependent on whether or not the transfer matrix represents a surjective mapping.

TI Temporally constrained ICA: An application to artifact rejection in
   electromagnetic brain signal analysis
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB Independent component analysis (ICA) is a technique which extracts statistically independent components from a set of measured. signals. The technique enjoys numerous applications in biomedical signal analysis in the literature, especially in the analysis of electromagnetic (EM) brain signals. Standard implementations of ICA are restrictive mainly due to the square mixing assumption-for signal recordings which have large numbers of channels, the large number of resulting extracted sources makes the subsequent analysis laborious and highly subjective. There are many instances in, neurophysiological analysis where there is strong a priori information about the signals being sought; temporally constrained ICA (cICA) can extract signals that are statistically independent, yet which are constrained to be similar to some reference signal which can incorporate such a priori information. We demonstrate this method on a synthetic dataset and on a number of. artifactual waveforms identified in multichannel recordings of EEG and MEG. cICA repeatedly converges to the desired component within a few iterations and subjective analysis shows the waveforms to be of the expected morphologies and with realistic spatial distributions. This paper shows that cICA can be applied with great success to EM brain signal analysis, With an initial application in automating artifact extraction in EEG and MEG.

TI Estimation of active cortical current source regions using a vector
   representation scanning approach
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB The objective of this article is to present a framework for cortical current source reconstruction that extracts a center and magnitude of electrical brain activity from EEG signals. High-resolution EEG recordings, a subject-specific MRI-based electromagnetic boundary element method (BEM) model, and a channel reduction technique are used. This new geometric measure combines the magnitude and spatial location of electrical brain activity of each of the identified subsets of channels into a three-dimensional resultant vector. The combination of the two approaches constitutes a source reconstruction scanning technique that provides a real-time estimation of cortical centers that can be tracked over time. Simulations demonstrate that the ability of this method to find the best-fit cortical location is more robust both in terms of accuracy and precision than traditional approaches for single-source conditions. Experimental validation demonstrates its ability to localize and separate cortical activity in plausible sites for two different motor tasks. Finally, this method provides a statistical measure to compare electrical brain activity associated with different motor tasks.

TI A mathematical approach to the temporal stationarity of background noise
   in MEG/EEG measurements
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB The general spatiotemporal covariance matrix of the background noise in MEG/EEG signals is huge. To reduce the dimensionality of this matrix it is modeled as a Kronecker product of a spatial and a temporal covariance matrix. When the number of time samples is larger than, say, J = 500, the iterative Maximum Likelihood estimation of these two matrices is still too time-consuming to be useful on a routine basis. In this study we looked for methods to circumvent this computationally expensive procedure by using a parametric model with subject-dependent parameters. Such a model would additionally help with interpreting MEG/EEG signals. For the spatial covariance, models have been derived already and it has been shown that measured MEG/EEG signals can be understood spatially as random processes, generated by random dipoles. The temporal covariance, however, has not been modeled yet, therefore we studied the temporal covariance matrix in several subjects. For all subjects the temporal covariance, shows an alpha oscillation and vanishes for large time lag. This gives rise to a temporal noise model consisting of two components: alpha activity and additional random noise. The alpha activity is modeled as randomly occurring waves with random phase and the covariance of the additional noise decreases exponentially with lag. This model requires only six parameters instead of 1/2J(J + 1). Theoretically, this model is stationary but in practice the stationarity of the matrix is highly influenced by the baseline correction. It appears that very good agreement between the data and the parametric model can be obtained when the baseline correction window is taken into account properly. This finding implies that the background noise is in principle a stationary process and that nonstationarities are mainly caused by the nature of the preprocessing method. When analyzing events at a fixed sample after the stimulus (e.g., the SEF N20 response) one can take advantage of this nonstationarity by optimizing the baseline window to obtain a low noise variance at this particular sample.

TI A resampling method for estimating the signal subspace of
   spatio-temporal EEG/MEG data
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB Source localization using spatio-temporal electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) data is usually performed by means of signal subspace methods. The first step of these methods is the estimation of a set of vectors that spans a subspace containing as well as possible the signal of interest. This estimation is usually performed by means of a singular value decomposition (SVD) of the data matrix: The rank of the signal subspace (denoted by r) is estimated from a plot in which the singular values are plotted against their rank order, and the signal subspace itself is estimated by the first r singular vectors. The main problem with this method is that it is strongly affected by spatial covariance in the noise. Therefore, two methods are proposed that are much less affected by this spatial covariance, and old and a new method. The old method involves prewhitening of the data matrix, making use of an estimate of the spatial noise covariance matrix. The new method is based on the matrix product of two average data matrices, resulting from a random partition of a set of stochastically independent replications of the spatio-temporal data matrix. The estimated signal subspace is obtained by first filtering out the asymmetric and negative definite components of this matrix product and then retaining the eigenvectors that correspond to the r largest eigenvalues of this filtered data matrix. The main advantages of the partition-based eigen decomposition over prewhited SVD is that 1) it does not require an estimate of the spatial noise covariance matrix and 2b) that it allows one to make use of a resampling distribution (the so-called partitioning distribution) as a natural quantification of the uncertainty in the estimated rank. The performance of three methods (SVD with and without prewhitening, and the partition-based method) is compared in a simulation study. From this study, it could be concluded that prewhited SVD and the partition-based eigen decomposition perform equally well when the amplitude time series are constant, but that the partition-based method performs better when the amplitude time series are variable.

TI Independent component analysis as a tool to eliminate artifacts in EEG:
   A quantitative study
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB Independent component analysis (ICA) is a novel technique that calculates independent components from mixed signals. A hypothetical clinical application is to remove artifacts in EEG. The goal of this study was to apply ICA to standard EEG recordings to eliminate well-known artifacts, thus quantifying its efficacy in an objective way. Eighty samples of recordings with spikes and evident artifacts of electrocardiogram (EKG), eye movements, 50-Hz interference, muscle, or electrode artifact were studied. ICA components were calculated using the Joint Approximate Diagonalization of Eigen-matrices (JADE) algorithm. The signal was reconstructed excluding those components related to the artifacts. A normalized correlation coefficient was used as a measure of the changes caused by the suppression of these components. ICA produced an evident clearing-up of signals in all the samples. The morphology and the topography of the spike were very similar before and after the removal of the artifacts. The correlation coefficient showed that the rest of the signal did not change significantly. Two examiners independently looked at the samples to identify the changes in the morphology and location of the discharge and the artifacts. In conclusion, ICA proved to be a useful tool to clean artifacts in short EEG samples, without having the disadvantages associated with the digital filters. The distortion of the interictal activity measured by correlation analysis was minimal.

TI Magnetoencephalography and its Achilles' heel
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-PARIS
AB Magnetoencephalography (MEG) has practically unlimited temporal resolution. Fundamental physical reasons, however, restrict the capability of MEG to separate simultaneously active sources. After a brief tutorial introduction into MEG, various aspects of spatial resolution are reviewed with the help of examples. First the estimation of a single current dipole is examined. A consideration of the resolution field shows that the spatial selectivity of the estimated dipole moment is highly dependent on methodological issues. A subsequent consideration of various two-dipole configurations illustrates how the topography of the magnetic field depends on the distance between the two dipoles and their relative orientations. The resolution fields associated with the estimation of the dipole moments reveal a strong interference for closely spaced dipoles. A simple model suggests that the standard deviations of the estimated moments are inversely proportional to the distance of the dipoles. Spatial information provided by techniques like functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) could help to overcome problems resulting from the limited spatial resolution of MEG (multimodal integration). But a straightforward synthesis, according to the principle that fMRI provides the spatial structure of the sources and MEG adds the temporal information, is probably doomed to failure in many situations. A serious dilemma, among other problems, is that the fMRI signal generally represents a temporal integral over several seconds: The knowledge that a certain brain region was active sometime or other is not necessarily helpful for disentangling the MEG activity within a specified short time window. An intriguing fact is that the spatio-temporal pattern of the MEG signals can be considered as a signature of the brain which is suitable for hypothesis testing with high temporal and spatial resolution.

TI In vivo measurement of the brain and skull resistivities using an
   EIT-based method and realistic models for the head
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB In vivo measurements of equivalent resistivities of skull (rho(skull)) and brain (rho(brain)) are performed for six subjects,using an electric impedance tomography (EIT)-based method and realistic models for the head.
   The classical boundary element method (BEM). formulation for EIT is very time consuming. However, the application of the Sherman-Morrison formula. reduces the computation time by a factor of 5. Using an optimal point distribution in the BEM model to optimize its accuracy, decreasing systematic errors of numerical origins is important because cost functions are shallow. Results demonstrate that rho(skull)/rho(brain) is more likely to be within 20 and 50 rather than equal to the commonly accepted value of, (.)80. The variation in rho(brain)(average = 301 Omega (.) cm, SD = 13%) and rho(skull)(average = 12230 Omega (.) cm, SD = 18%) is decreased by half, when compared with the results using the sphere model, showing that the correction for geometry errors is essential to obtain realistic estimations. However, a factor of 2.4 may stil exist between values of rho(skull)/rho(brain) corresponding to different subjects. Earlier results show the necessity of calibrating rho(brain) and rho(skull) by measuring them in vivo-for each subject, in order to decrease errors associated with the electroencephalogram inverse problem. We show that the proposed method is suited to this goal.

TI Multimodal integration of high-resolution EEG and functional magnetic
   resonance imaging data: a simulation study
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB Previous simulation studies have stressed the importance of the use of fMRI priors in the estimation of cortical current density. However, no systematic variations of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and number of electrodes were explicitly taken into account in the estimation process. In this simulation study we considered the utility of including information as estimated from fMRI. This was done by using as the dependent variable both the correlation coefficient and the relative error between the imposed and the estimated waveforms at the level of cortical region of interests (ROI). A realistic head and cortical surface model was used. Factors used in the simulations were the different values of SNR of the scalp-generated data, the different inverse operators used to estimated the cortical source activity, the strengths of the fMRI priors in the fMRI-based inverse operators, and the number of scalp electrodes used in the analysis. Analysis of variance results suggested that all the considered factors significantly afflict the correlation and the relative error between the estimated and the simulated cortical activity. For the ROIs analyzed with simulated fMRI hot spots, it was observed that the best estimation of cortical source currents was performed with the inverse operators that used fMRI information. When the ROIs analyzed do not present fMRI hot spots, both standard (i.e., minimum norm) and fMRI-based inverse operators returned statistically equivalent correlation and relative error values.

TI A comparative study of global optimization approaches to MEG source
   localization
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER MATHEMATICS
AB It is well-known that the problem of MEG source localization can be cast as an optimization problem. So far, there have been many works in which various optimization methods were adopted for source localization. In this paper, we compare the performance of three typical and widely used optimization techniques for a specific MEG source localization problem. We first introduce a hybrid algorithm by combining genetic and local search strategies to overcome disadvantages of conventional genetic algorithms. Second, we apply the tabu search, a widely used optimization method in combinational optimization and discrete mathematics, to source localization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt in the literature to apply tabu search to MEG/EEG source localization. Third, in order to further compare the performance of the above algorithms, simulated annealing is also applied to MEG source localization problem. The computer simulation results show that our local genetic algorithm is the most effective approach to dipole localization, and the tabu search method is also a very good strategy for this problem.

TI Statistical performance analysis of signal variance-based dipole models
   for MEG/EEG source localization and detection
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB A set of dipole fitting algorithms that incorporate different assumptions about the variability of the signal component into their mathematical models is presented and analyzed. Dipole fitting is performed by minimizing the squared error between the selected data model and available data. Dipole models based on moments that have 1) constant amplitude and orientation, 2) variable amplitude and fixed known orientation, 3) variable amplitude and fixed unknown orientation, and 4) variable amplitude and variable orientation are considered. The presence of a dipolar source is determined by comparing the fractional energy explained by the dipole model to a threshold. Source localization is accomplished by searching to find the location that explains the largest fractional signal energy using a dipole model. Expressions for the probability of a false positive decision and probability of correct detection are derived and used to evaluate the effect of variability in the dipole on performance and to address the effects of model mismatch and location errors. Simulated and measured data experiments are presented to illustrate the performance of, both detection and localization methods. The results indicate that models which account for variance outperform the constant orientation and magnitude model even when the number of observations is relatively small and the signal of interest contains a very modest variance component.

AB Localizing and quantifying the sources of ElectroEncephaloGraphy (EEG) and MagnetoEncephaloGraphy (MEG) measurements is an ill-posed inverse problem, whose solution requires a spatial regularization involving both anatomical and functional priors. The distributed source model enables the introduction of such constraints. However, the resulting solution is unstable since the equation system one has to solve is badly conditioned and under-determined. We propose an original approach for solving the inverse problem, that allows to deal with a better-determined system and to temper the influence of priors according to their consistency with the measured EEG/MEG data. This Localization Estimation Algorithm (LEA) estimates the amplitude of a selected subset of sources, which are localized based on a prior distribution of activation probability. LEA is evaluated through numerical simulations and compared to a classical Weighted Minimum Norm estimation.

TI Independent component analysis for unaveraged single-trial MEG data
   decomposition and single-dipole source localization
SO NEUROCOMPUTING
AB This paper presents a novel method for decomposing and localizing unaveraged single-trial magnetoencephalographic data based on the independent component analysis (ICA) approach associated with pre- and post-processing techniques. In the pre-processing stage, recorded single-trial raw data are first decomposed into uncorrelated signals with the reduction of high-power additive noise. In the stage of source separation, the decorrelated source signals are further decomposed into independent source components. In the post-processing stage, we perform a source localization procedure to seek a single-dipole map of decomposed individual source components, e.g., evoked responses. The first results of applying the proposed robust ICA approach to single-trial data with phantom and auditory evoked field tasks indicate the following. (1) A source signal is successfully extracted from unaveraged single-trial phantom data. The accuracy of dipole estimation for the decomposed source is even better than that of taking the average of total trials. (2) Not only the behavior and location of individual neuronal sources can be obtained but also the activity strength (amplitude) of evoked responses corresponding to a stimulation trial can be obtained and visualized. Moreover, the dynamics of individual neuronal sources, such as the trial-by-trial variations of the amplitude and location, can be observed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Time-coherent expansion of MEG/EEG cortical sources
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB In this study we estimated the spatial extent of cortical areas of time-coherent activity using the inverse problem in magneto/electroencephalography (MEEG). The model discussed here uses classical regularization tools in order to force the inverse solution to be piece-wise coherent. First, the cortex was seeded by focal dipolar sources. Then, a time-coherent expansion (TCE) onto the cortical surface was performed in order to obtain surface source models composed of patches with uniform current density. Patches represent extended cortical regions with one single time course per active area. Results obtained from synthetic data show that using the TCE method is relevant even with a low signal-to-noise ratio, although the final estimation is often slightly biased. We applied the TCE method to evoked magnetic fields obtained after electrical stimulation of fingers in order to estimate the somatotopic cortical maps of the primary somatosensory cortex.

TI Estimation of neural dynamics from MEG/EEG cortical current density
   maps: Application, to the reconstruction of large-scale cortical
   synchrony
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB There is a growing interest in elucidating the role of specific patterns of neural dynamics-such as transient synchronization between distant cell assemblies-in brain functions. Magnetoencephalography (MEG)/electroencephalography (EEG) recordings consist in the spatial integration of the activity from large and multiple remotely located populations of neurons. Massive diffusive effects and poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) preclude the proper estimation of indices related to cortical dynamics from nonaveraged MEG/EEG surface recordings. Source localization from MEG/EEG surface recordings with its excellent time resolution could contribute to a better understanding of the working brain.
   We propose a robust and original approach to the MEG/EEG distributed inverse problem to better estimate neural dynamics of cortical sources. For this, the surrogate data method is introduced in the MEG/EEG inverse problem framework. We apply this approach on nonaveraged data with poor SNR using the minimum norm estimator and find source localization results weakly sensitive to noise. Surrogates allow the reduction of the source space in order to reconstruct MEG/EEG data with reduced biases in both source localization and time-series dynamics. Monte Carlo simulations and results obtained from real MEG data indicate it is possible to estimate non invasively an important part of cortical source locations and dynamic and, therefore, to reveal brain functional networks.

AB This paper evaluates the performance of the extended-infomax independent component analysis (ICA) algorithm in a simulated biomedical blind source separation problem. Independent signals representing an alpha-wave and a heartbeat are generated and then mixed linearly in the presence of white or pink noise to simulate a one-minute recording of an electroencephalogram and an electrocardiogram. The selected ICA algorithm separates the white and pink noise equally well. The maximum estimation signal-to-noise ratio of the source estimates is equivalent to the added noise level, so the separation is optimum to second-order. The higher-order demixing performance, as measured by the Amari index. indicates that when the noise contamination exceeds the mixing contamination the ICA separation is reduced. These results represent a lower bound to the performance of extended-infomax ICA in noisy, time-correlated electrophysiological conditions.

TI Estimating stationary dipoles from MEG/EEG data contaminated with
   spatially and temporally correlated background noise
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING
AB The stationary dipole model for the inverse problem of magnetoencepholographic (MEG) and electroencepholographic (EEG) data is extended by including spatio-temporal correlations of the background noise. For that purpose, the spatio-temporal covariances are described as a Kronkecker product of a spatial and a temporal covariance matrix. The maximum likelihood method is used to estimate this Kronecker product from a series of trials of MEG/EEG data.
   A simulation study shows that the inclusion of the background noise generally improves the dipole estimate substantially. When the frequency of the source time functions, however, coincides with the frequency contents of the covariance function, the dipole estimate worsens when the temporal correlations are included. The inclusion of spatial correlations always improves the estimates.

TI Spatiotemporal EEG/MEG source analysis based on a parametric-noise
   covariance model
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB A method is described to incorporate the spatiotemporal noise covariance matrix into a spatiotemporal source analysis. The essential feature is that the estimation problem is split into two parts. First, a model is fitted to the observed noise covariance matrix. This model is a Kronecker product of a spatial and a temporal matrix. The spatial matrix models the spatial covariances by a function dependent on sensor distance. The temporal matrix models the temporal covariances as lag dependent. In the second part, sources are estimated given this noise model, which can be done very efficiently due to the Kronecker formulation.
   An application to real electroencephalogram (EEG) data shows that the noise model fits the data very well. Simulation results show that the resulting source estimates are more precise than those obtained from a standard analysis neglecting the noise covariance. In addition, the estimated standard errors of the source parameter estimates are far more precise than those obtained from a standard analysis. Finally, the source parameter standard errors are used to investigate the effects of temporal sampling. It is shown that increasing the sampling by a factor x, decreases the standard errors of all source parameters with the square root of x.

TI Classical and Bayesian inference in neuroimaging: Theory
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB This paper reviews hierarchical observation models, used in functional neuroimaging, in a Bayesian light. It emphasizes the common ground shared by classical and Bayesian methods to show that conventional analyses of neuroimaging data can be usefully extended within an empirical Bayesian framework. In particular we formulate the procedures used in conventional data analysis in terms of hierarchical linear models and establish a connection between classical inference and parametric empirical Bayes (PEB) through covariance component estimation. This estimation is based on an expectation maximization or EM algorithm. The key point is that hierarchical models not only provide for appropriate inference at the highest level but that one can revisit lower levels suitably equipped to make Bayesian inferences. Bayesian inferences eschew many of the difficulties encountered with classical inference and characterize brain responses in a way that is more directly predicated on what one is interested in. The motivation for Bayesian approaches is reviewed and the theoretical background is presented in a way that relates to conventional methods, in particular restricted maximum likelihood (ReML). This paper is a technical and theoretical prelude to subsequent papers that deal with applications of the theory to a range of important issues in neuroimaging. These issues include; (i) Estimating nonsphericity or variance components in fMRI time-series that can arise from serial correlations within subject, or are induced by multisubject (i.e., hierarchical) studies. (ii) Spatiotemporal Bayesian models for imaging data, in which voxels-specific effects are constrained by responses in other voxels. (iii) Bayesian estimation of nonlinear models of hemodynamic responses and (iv) principled ways of mixing structural and functional priors in EEG source reconstruction. Although diverse, all these estimation problems are accommodated by the PEB framework described in this paper. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

TI Systematic source estimation of spikes by a combination of independent
   component analysis and RAP-MUSIC I: Principles and simulation study
SO CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB Objectives: We propose a combination of independent component analysis (ICA) and recursively applied and projected multiple signal classification (RAP-MUSIC) as a new approach to dipole source estimation of epileptiform discharges. The method is minimally dependent on subjective decisions.
   Methods: Ten electroencephalographic (EEG) data matrices were generated by computer, each matrix including real background activity from a normal subject and an array of added simulated spikes. Each spike was a summation of two transients originating from slightly different 'original dipole sources'. The unaveraged EEG matrices were decomposed by ICA, and source estimation was performed by applying RAP-MUSIC to the spatial information defined by the ICA components showing epileptiform activity in their waveform. For comparison, dipoles were also estimated from the same matrices using two existing methods: RAP-MUSIC based on eigen-decomposition of the covariance matrices of averaged spikes and common spatial pattern decomposition.
   Results: In every simulated EEG data matrix, two dipoles close to the original sources were estimated by the present method. Their unaveraged activities were also similar to those of the original sources. The two existing methods gave less precise results than the proposed method.
   Conclusions: RAP-MUSIC based on ICA thus proved promising for source estimation of unaveraged epileptiform discharges. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Systematic source estimation of spikes by a combination of independent
   component analysis and RAP-MUSIC II: Preliminary clinical application
SO CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB Objectives: We tried to estimate epileptic sources by a combination of independent component analysis (ICA) and recursively applied and projected multiple signal classification (RAP-MUSIC) in real epileptiform EEG discharges.
   Methods: EEG data including an array of spikes from 3 patients were decomposed by ICA, and source estimation was performed by applying RAP-MUSIC to the spatial information defined by the set of ICA components that showed epileptiform activity in their waveform. Sources were also estimated from the same data using RAP-MUSIC based on eigen-decomposition of the covariance matrix of averaged spikes, and common spatial pattern decomposition for comparison.
   Results: RAP-MUSIC based on ICA could estimate generally correct epileptic sources in the 3 patients, and its results were better than those of the other methods, when compared to intracerebral data. The present analysis proceeded without introduction of subjective decision after data selection. The separation of epileptiform discharges from the background is essential for this analysis, and was successfully performed in the real EEG data.
   Conclusions: RAP-MUSIC based on ICA appears promising for estimation of epileptic sources with minimal dependence on subjective decisions in the process of analysis. In particular, it was not necessary to select the number of sources. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Monte Carlo simulation studies of EEG and MEG localization accuracy
SO HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING
AB Both electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are currently used to localize brain activity. The accuracy of source localization depends on numerous factors, including the specific inverse approach and source model, fundamental differences in EEG and MEG data, and the accuracy of the volume conductor model of the head (i.e., the forward model). Using Monte Carlo simulations, this study removes the effect of forward model errors and theoretically compares the use of EEG alone, MEG alone, and combined EEG/MEG data sets for source localization. Here, we use a linear estimation inverse approach with a distributed source model and a realistic forward head model. We evaluated its accuracy using the crosstalk and point spread metrics. The crosstalk metric for a specified location on the cortex describes the amount of activity incorrectly localized onto that location from other locations. The point spread metric provides the complementary measure: for that same location, the point spread describes the mis-localization of activity from that specified location to other locations in the brain. We also propose and examine the utility of a "noise sensitivity normalized" inverse operator. Given our particular forward and inverse models, our results show that 1) surprisingly, EEG localization is more accurate than MEG localization for the same number of sensors averaged over many source locations and orientations; 2) as expected, combining EEG with MEG produces the best accuracy for the same total number of sensors; 3) the noise sensitivity normalized inverse operator improves the spatial resolution relative to the standard linear estimation operator; and 4) use of an a priori fMRI constraint universally reduces both crosstalk and point spread.

TI A new method to identify multiple sources of oscillatory activity from
   magnetoencephalographic data
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB Identifying the sources of oscillatory activity in the human brain is a challenging problem in current magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) research. The fluctuations in phase and amplitude of cortical oscillations preclude signal averaging over successive sections of the data without a priori assumptions. In addition, several sources at different locations often produce oscillatory activity at similar frequencies. For example, spontaneous oscillatory activity in the 8- to 13-Hz band is produced simultaneously at least in the posterior parts of the brain and bilaterally in the sensorimotor cortices. The previous approaches of identifying sources of oscillatory activity by dipole modeling of bandpass filtered data are quite laborious and require that multiple criteria are defined by an experienced user. In this work we introduce a convenient method for source localization using minimum current estimates in the frequency domain. Individual current estimates are calculated for the Fourier transforms of successive sections of continuous data. These current estimates are then averaged. The algorithm was tested on simulated and measured MEG data and compared with conventional dipole modeling. The main advantage of the proposed method is that it provides an efficient approach for simultaneous estimation of multiple sources of oscillatory activity in the same frequency band.

TI A spline Laplacian ECG estimator in a realistic geometry volume
   conductor
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB We have developed, a spline-based Laplacian estimator over an arbitrarily shaped surface of a volume conductor and tested its applicability to Laplacian electrocardiogram (ECG) mappings In the newly developed algorithm, estimation of the parameters associated with the spline Laplacian is formulated by seeking the general inverse of a transfer matrix. Only one spline-parameter needs to be determined through regularization in order to estimate the realistic geometry surface Laplacian from the body surface potentials. It has been demonstrated that the rich knowledge on regularization in the inverse problems can be directly applied to estimate the spline Laplacian ECG (LECG), such as the discrepancy principle. Computer simulations have been conducted to validate the new approach in a spherical volume conductor and test the feasibility of mapping cardiac electrical sources in a realistic geometry heart-torso model. The present results demonstrate that the, realistic geometry spline LECG can be estimated conveniently from the body surface potentials, is more robust against measurement noise and has better performance than the conventional five-point local Laplacian estimator.

TI Comparison of data transformation procedures to enhance topographical
   accuracy in time-series analysis of the human EEG
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS
AB We describe a methodology to apply current source density (CSD) and minimum norm (MN) estimation as pre-processing tools for time-series analysis of single trial EEG data. The performance of these methods is compared for the case of wavelet time-frequency analysis of simulated gamma-band activity. A reasonable comparison of CSD and MN on the single trial level requires regularization such that the corresponding transformed data sets have similar signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). For region-of-interest approaches, it should be possible to optimize the SNR for single estimates rather than for the whole distributed solution. An effective implementation of the MN method is described. Simulated data sets were created by modulating the strengths of a radial and a tangential test dipole with wavelets in the frequency range of the gamma band, superimposed with simulated spatially uncorrelated noise, The MN and CSD transformed data sets as well as the average reference (AR) representation were subjected to wavelet frequency-domain analysis, and power spectra were mapped for relevant frequency bands. For both CSD and MN, the influence of noise can be sufficiently suppressed by regularization to yield meaningful information, but only MN represents both radial and tangential dipole sources appropriately as single peaks. Therefore, when relating wavelet power spectrum topographies to their neuronal generators, MN should be preferred. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Cortical source estimate of combined high resolution EEG and fMRI data
   related to voluntary movements
SO METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE
AB Objectives. In this paper, we employed advanced methods for the modeling of human cortical activity related to voluntary right one-digit movements from combined high-resolution electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
   Methods: Multimodal integration between EEG and fMRI data was performed by using realistic head models, a large number of scalp electrodes (128) and the estimation of current density strengths by linear inverse estimation.
   Results. Increasing of spatial details of the estimated cortical density distributions has been detected by using the proposed integration method with respect to the estimation using EEG data alone.
   Conclusion: The proposed method of multimodal EEG-fMRI data is useful to increase spatial resolution of movement-related potentials and can also be applied to other kinds of event-related potentials.

TI The influence of brain tissue anisotropy on human EEG and MEG
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB The influence of gray and white matter tissue anisotropy on the human electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetoencephalogram (MEG) was examined with a high resolution finite element model of the head of an adult male subject. The conductivity tensor data for gray and white matter were estimated from magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging. Simulations were carried out with single dipoles or small extended sources in the cortical gray matter. The inclusion of anisotropic volume conduction in the brain was found to have a minor influence on the topology of EEG and MEG (and hence source localization). We found a major influence on the amplitude of EEG and MEG (and hence source strength estimation) due to the change in conductivity and the inclusion of anisotropy. We expect that inclusion of tissue anisotropy information will improve source estimation procedures. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science.

TI Linear inverse source estimate of combined EEG and MEG data related to
   voluntary movements
SO HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING
AB A method for the modeling of human movement-related cortical activity from combined electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) data is proposed. This method includes a subject's multi-compartment head model (scalp, skull, dura mater, cortex) constructed from magnetic resonance images, multi-dipole source model, and a regularized linear inverse source estimate based on boundary element mathematics. Linear inverse source estimates of cortical activity were regularized by taking into account the covariance of background EEG and MEG sensor noise. EEG (121 sensors) and MEG (43 sensors) data were recorded in separate sessions whereas normal subjects executed voluntary right one-digit movements. Linear inverse source solution of EEG, MEG, and EEG-MEG data were quantitatively evaluated by using three performance indexes. The first two indexes (Dipole Localization Error [DLE] and Spatial Dispersion [SDis]) were used to compute the localization power for the source solutions obtained. Such indexes were based on the information provided by the column of the resolution matrix (i.e., impulse response). Ideal DLE values tend to zero (the source current was correctly retrieved by the procedure). In contrast, high DLE values suggest severe mislocalization in the source reconstruction. A high value of SDis at a source space point mean that such a source will be retrieved by a large area with the linear inverse source estimation. The remaining performance index assessed the quality of the source solution based on the information provided by the rows of the resolution matrix R, i.e., resolution kernels. The i-th resolution kernels of the matrix R describe how the estimation of the i-th source is distorted by the concomitant activity of all other sources. A statistically significant lower dipole localization error was observed and lower spatial dispersion in source solutions produced by combined EEG-MEG data than from EEG and MEG data considered separately (P < 0.05). These effects were not due to an increased number of sensors in the combined EEG-MEG solutions. They result from the independence of source information conveyed by the multimodal measurements. From a physiological point of view, the linear inverse source solution of EEG-MEG data suggested a contralaterally preponderant bilateral activation of primary sensorimotor cortex from the preparation to the execution of the movement. This activation was associated with that of the supplementary motor area. The activation of bilateral primary sensorimotor cortical areas was greater during the processing of afferent information related to the ongoing movement than in the preparation for the motor act. In conclusion, the linear inverse source estimate of combined MEG and EEG data improves the estimate of movement-related cortical activity. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

In this study we present a fast method for measuring the head position while neuromagnetic data are acquired. We then compare two methods for removing the effect of the movements in neuromagnetic source estimation and magnetic field alignment: minimum-norm estimate alignment and forward calculation correction. Simulations and a test measurement show that the proposed head position measurement method works with millimeter precision and that incorporating the effect of the head movements into the magnetic field forward calculations is an efficient and a sufficiently accurate method for correcting for the head movements.

SO ANNALS OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB In this paper a new algorithm is proposed to enhance the spatial resolution of solutions of the underdetermined EEG inverse problem. Termed the self-coherence enhancement algorithm (SCEA), the present algorithm provides a self-coherence solution, which is a function of the high order self-coherence estimate of an unbiased smooth estimate of the underdetermined EEG inverse solution. The order of the high order self-coherence function is determined by the blurring level of the actual source distribution as represented by a normalized blurring index. The proposed SCEA algorithm may be used to enhance the spatial resolution of an inverse solution obtained by any inverse reconstruction algorithm. Computer simulation studies have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the SCEA and to compare its performance to that of the LORETA and the FOCUSS algorithms.

These methods include a subject's multicompartment head model (scalp, skull, dura mater, cortex) constructed from magnetic resonance images, multidipole source model, and regularized linear inverse source estimate based on boundary element mathematics. Furthermore, determination of the priors in the resolution of the linear inverse problem was performed with the use of information from the hemodynamic responses of the cortical areas as revealed by block-designed (strength of activated voxels) and event-related (coupling of activated voxels) fMRI. Linear inverse source estimates of cortical activity were regularized by taking into account the covariance of background EEG sensor noise. As an example, these methods were applied to EEG (128 electrodes) and fMRI data, which were recorded in separate sessions while normal subjects executed voluntary right one-digit movements.

TI Estimation of the EEG power spectrum using MRI T-2 relaxation time in
   traumatic brain injury
SO CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB Objectives: To study the relationship between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T-2 relaxation time and the power spectrum of the electroencephalogram (EEG) in long-term follow up of traumatic brain injury.
   Methods: Nineteen channel quantitative electroencephalograms or qEEG, tests of cognitive function and quantitative MRI T-2 relaxation times (qMRI) were measured in 18 mild to severe closed head injured outpatients 2 months to 4.6 years after injury and 11 normal controls. MRI T-2 and the Laplacian of T-2 were then correlated with the power spectrum of the scalp electrical potentials and current source densities of the qEEG.
   Results: qEEG and qMRI T-2 were related by a frequency tuning with maxima in the alpha (8-12 Hz) and the lower EEG frequencies (0.5-5 Hz), which varied as a function of spatial location. The Laplacian of T2 acted like a spatial-temporal 'lens' by increasing the spatial-temporal resolution of correlation between 3-dimensional T-2 and the ear referenced alert but resting spontaneous qEEG.
   Conclusions: The severity of traumatic brain injury can be modeled by a linear transfer function that relates the molecular qMRI to qEEG resonant frequencies. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

   localization with a realistic head model
SO CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB Objectives: Inaccurate information about the electrode locations on the scalp will introduce errors in electroencephalogram dipole source localization results. The present study uses computer simulations to evaluate such errors in a realistic head model and in the context of noise.
   Methods: A realistic head model was constructed from magnetic resonance imaging scans and 29 electrodes placed on the head according to the 10-20 International System. Twenty sets of electrode displacements, with a mean, value of 5 mm, were generated and 200 single dipoles evenly located in the brain were used as test sources. The boundary element method was employed for the froward calculation and dipole fitting was carried out at different noise levels.
   Results: For a noise-free signal, the source localization error due to electrode misplacement is about 5 mm, whereas it is about 2 mm for normal noisy signals.
   Conclusions: For realistic head models, dipole estimation error due to electrode misplacement is negligible compared with errors caused by noise. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Fast realistic modeling in bioelectromagnetism using lead-field
   interpolation
SO HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING
AB The practical use of realistic models in bioelectromagnetism is limited by the time-consuming amount of numerical calculations. We propose a method leading to much higher speed than currently available, and compatible with any kind of numerical methods (boundary elements (BEM), finite elements, finite differences). Illustrated with the BEM for EEG and MEG, it applies to ECG and MCG as well. The principle is two-fold. First, a Lead-Field matrix is calculated (once for all) for a grid of dipoles covering the brain volume. Second, any forward solution is interpolated from the pre-calculated Lead-Fields corresponding to grid dipoles near the source. Extrapolation is used for shallow sources falling outside the grid. Three interpolation techniques were tested: trilinear, second-order Bezier (Bernstein polynomials), and 3D spline. The trilinear interpolation yielded the highest speed gain, with factors better than x 10,000 for a 9,000-triangle BEM model. More accurate results could be obtained with the Bezier interpolation (speed gain similar to1,000), which, combined with a 8-mm step grid, lead to intrinsic localization and orientation errors of only 0.2 mm and 0.2 degrees. Further improvements in MEG could be obtained by interpolating only the contribution of secondary currents. Cropping grids by removing shallow points lead to a much better estimation of the dipole orientation in EEG than when solving the forward problem classically, providing an efficient alternative to locally refined models. This method would show special usefulness when combining realistic models with stochastic inverse procedures (simulated annealing, genetic algorithms) requiring many forward calculations.

AB A method is described to derive source and conductivity estimates in a simultaneous MEG and EEG source analysis. In addition the covariance matrix of the estimates is derived. Simulation studies with a concentric spheres model and a more realistic boundary element model indicate that this method has several advantages, even if only a few EEG sensors are added to a MEG configuration. First, a simultaneous analysis profits from the 'preferred' location directions of MEG and EEG. Second, deep sources can be estimated quite accurately, which is an advantage compared to MEG. Third. superficial profit from accurate MEG location and from accurate EEG moment. Fourth, the radial source component can be estimated, which is an advantage compared to MEG, Fifth, the conductivities can be estimated. It is shown that conductivity estimation gives a substantial increase in precision, even if the conductivities are not identified appropriately. An illustrative analysis of empirical data supports these findings.

TI Analysis of pain-related somatosensory evoked magnetic fields using the
   MUSIC (multiple signal classification) algorithm for
   magnetoencephalography
SO NEUROREPORT
AB We evaluated the effectiveness of the Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm by analysing pain-related somatosensory-evoked magnetic fields (SEFs) by 148-channel whole-head-type magnetoencephalography. MUSIC peaks of middle latency components were located around the primary somatosensory cortex (SI), contralateral to the stimulated finger. Long latency components were located around the bilateral secondary somatosensory cortices (SII) and cingulate gyri. Peaks at the SII and cingulate gyri were more prominent on very painful and moderately painful stimulation than on weak stimulation. The results were in very good agreement with results from single dipole estimation. These findings suggest that the MUSIC algorithm could be a useful tool for analysis of pain-related SEFs.

TI Estimated generalized least squares electromagnetic source analysis
   based on a parametric noise covariance model
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB Estimated generalized least squares (EGLS) electromagnetic source analysis is used to downweight noisy and correlated data. Standard EGLS requires many trials to accurately estimate the noise covariances and, thus, the source parameters. Alternatively, the noise covariances can be modeled parametrically. Only the parameters of the model describing the noise covariances need to be estimated and, therefore, less trials are required. This method is referred to as parametric egls (PEGLS). In this paper, PEGLS is developed and its performance is tested in a simulation study and in a pseudoempirical study.

TI Equivalent dipole source imaging of brain electric activity by means of
   parametric projection filter
SO ANNALS OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB In the present study, spatial filters for inverse estimation of an equivalent dipole layer from the scalp-recorded potentials have been explored for their suitability in achieving high-resolution electroencephalogram (EEG) imaging. The performance of the parametric projection filter (PPF), which we propose to use for high-resolution EEG imaging, has been evaluated by computer simulations in the presence of a priori information on noise. An inhomogeneous three-concentric-sphere head model was used in the present simulation study to represent the head volume conductor. An equivalent dipole layer was used to model brain electric sources and estimated From the scalp potentials. Various noise conditions were simulated and the parametric projection filter was compared with standard regularization procedures such as the truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD) and the Tikhonov regularization (TKNV). The present simulation results suggest that the proposed method performs better than that of commonly used inverse regularization techniques, such as the general inverse using the TSVD and the TKNV, when the correlation between the original source distribution and the noise distribution is low, and performs similarly when the correlation is high. A method for determining the optimum regularization parameter, which can be applied to parametric inverse techniques, has also been developed. (C) 2001 Biomedical Engineering Society.

TI A new computational approach for cortical imaging
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING
AB Estimation of current or potential distribution on the cortex is used to obtain information about neural sources from the scalp recorded electroencephalogram. If the active sources in the brain are superficial, the estimated field distribution on the cortex also yields information about the active source configuration. In these cases, these methods can be used as source localization methods,In this study, we concentrate on finite-element-based cortex potential estimation, Usually these methods require surface interpolation of the recorded voltages at the electrodes onto the entire scalp surface. We propose a new computational approach which does not require the use of surface interpolation but does it implicitly and uses only the recorded data at the electrodes, We refer to this method as the systematic approach (SA), We compare the SA with the surface interpolation approach (IA) and show that the SA is able to produce somewhat better accuracy than the IA, However, the main asset is that the sensitivity of the cortical potential maps to regularization parameter is significantly lower than with the IA.

TI Magnetoencephalographic (MEG) localization of the auditory N400m:
   effects of stimulus duration
SO NEUROREPORT
AB The effects of stimulus duration on the elicitation and equivalent current dipole (ECD) localization of the auditory N400(m) were studied in two subject groups, either familiar or unfamiliar with Finnish language, using a sentence-processing paradigm with incongruent ending words of either short or long duration. tong-duration words elicited a broad response at around 400 ms, the generator location(s) of which could not be reliably determined using ECD estimation. In contrast, short-duration words elicited a sharp, strong-amplitude response at about 400 ms latency and it's source location could be reliably determined as being in the vicinity of auditory cortex. Subjects unfamiliar with the Finnish language elicited no response at the 400 ms range. Thus, the use of short-duration words appears to be an important prerequisite for-the elicitation and localization of N400m. The differential amplitude behaviour of the N400m between the two subject groups further suggests that comprehension of the semantic content of the speech message is also required.

TI Source localization of induced cortical oscillations during tactile
   finger stimulation
SO BIOMEDIZINISCHE TECHNIK
AB We investigated the EEG beta event-related synchronization (ERS) after tactile finger stimulation in three subjects. Prior studies from our group using electrical stimulation and self-paced movement showed a beta rebound within one second after stimulation respectively movement offset. As the tactile-stimulation-data showed a similar ERS behaviour, we extracted the cortical sources for this beta rebound by the linear estimation method in order to see whether the representation areas of different fingers were distinguishable (as is possible with MEG data). Although realistic head models of two subjects were used for the calculations the fingers could not be spatially distinguished. However, regarding the whole spatio-temporal pattern of the ERS for different fingers clear differences can be observed.

TI Evaluation of inverse methods and head models for EEG source
   localization using a human skull phantom
SO PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
AB We used a real-skull phantom head to investigate the performances of representative methods for EEG source localization when considering various head models.
   We describe several experiments using a montage with current sources located at multiple positions and orientations inside a human skull filled with a conductive medium. The robustness of selected methods based on distributed source models is evaluated as various solutions to the forward problem (from the sphere to the finite element method) are considered.
   Experimental results indicate that inverse methods using appropriate cortex-based source models are almost always able to locate the active source with excellent precision, with little or no spurious activity in close or distant regions, even when two sources are simultaneously active.
   Superior regularization schemes for solving the inverse problem can dramatically help the estimation of sparse and focal active zones, despite significant approximation of the head geometry and the conductivity properties of the head tissues. Realistic head models are necessary, though, to fit the data with a reasonable level of residual variance.
