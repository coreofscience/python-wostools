AB Vehicle state estimation during anti-lock braking is considered. A novel
   nonlinear observer based on a vehicle dynamics model and a simplified
   Pacejka tire model is introduced in order to provide estimates of
   longitudinal and lateral vehicle velocities and the tire-road friction
   coefficient for vehicle safety control systems, specifically anti-lock
   braking control. The approach differs from previous work on vehicle
   state estimation in two main respects. The first is the introduction of
   a switched nonlinear observer in order to deal with the fact that in
   some driving situations the information provided by the sensor is not
   sufficient to carry out state estimation (i.e., not all states are
   observable). This is shown through an observability analysis. The second
   contribution is the introduction of tire-road friction estimation
   depending on vehicle longitudinal motion. Stability properties of the
   observer are analyzed using a Lyapunov function based method. Practical
   applicability of the proposed nonlinear observer is shown by means of
   experimental results. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we investigate the observer design problem of diesel
   engine selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems. Considering the main
   chemical reactions, the SCR systems are modeled by assuming that the
   states are homogenous inside and SCR cells as continuous stirred tank
   reactors. The obtained system model is nonlinear and the states are
   coupled. Since the ammonia coverage ratio is not measurable by a
   physical sensor and the ammonia sensor is relatively costly, NOx sensors
   are used to estimate the system states. The observability of the system
   is analyzed under the framework of the linear parameter-varying (LPV)
   system via transforming the nonlinear SCR system into a quasi-LPV form.
   A nonlinear observer is proposed and the method of tuning the observer
   gains is developed. The stability of the estimation error system is
   guaranteed with the designed observer gains. Finally, an experimental
   test with various operating points is conducted to show the
   effectiveness of the designed observer. It infers from the results that
   the designed observer has a good performance and the states are
   estimated well.

AB In this paper, we propose a nonlinear controller that stabilizes
   unmanned aerial vehicles in GPS-denied environments with respect to
   visual targets by using only onboard sensing. The translational velocity
   of the vehicle is estimated online with a nonlinear observer, which
   exploits spherical visual features as the main source of information.
   With the proposed solution, only four visual features have shown to be
   enough for the observer to operate in a real scenario. In addition, the
   observer is computationally light with constant numerical complexity,
   involving small-dimension matrices. The observer output is then
   exploited in a nonlinear controller designed with an integral
   backstepping approach, thus yielding a novel robust control system. By
   means of Lyapunov analysis, the stability of the closed-loop system is
   proved. Extensive simulation and experimental tests with a quadrotor are
   carried out to verify the validity and robustness of the proposed
   approach. The control system runs fully onboard on a standard processor,
   and only a low-cost sensing suite is employed. Tracking of a target
   whose speed exceeds 2m/s is also considered in the real-hardware
   experiments.

AB In this paper, a first strategy to reconstruct the piston position of a
   pneumatic cylinder supplied by two servovalves is proposed using only
   the chambers pressure measurements. This work focuses on the position
   observation at standstill. Starting from a classical model of this
   actuator, a transformation of the inputs is used. This way, for the
   first time, a link is established between electro-pneumatic actuators
   and Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSM). This allows to apply
   PMSM zero speed observation strategies to electro-pneumatic actuators.
   Thus, following an observability analysis, a signal injection based
   methodology is used to ensure the observability of the electro-pneumatic
   system. A non-linear position observer is synthesized and a Lyapunov
   function is provided to ensure the global stability. Experimental
   results confirm the proposed strategy efficiency. The proposed technique
   constitutes a first step toward sensorless position control of
   electro-pneumatic actuators. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   regression models of the recursive least squares (RLS) with forgetting
   factors and constraints are constructed based on simplified lateral
   dynamic models for estimating tire cornering stiffness. In addition, a
   nonlinear observer of sideslip angle is designed for
   four-in-wheel-motor-driven electric vehicles (FIWMD-EVs) with the
   estimated information on tire cornering stiffness. Sideslip angle can be
   estimated through a first-order Stirling's interpolation filter
   (DD1-filter) and a firstorder low-pass filter. The reliability,
   feasibility, effectiveness, and practicality of simplified lateral
   dynamic models are verified by contrast simulation experiments. The
   simplified lateral dynamic models of front and rear tires are not
   influenced on the change of sideslip angle, nor influenced by each
   other. Moreover, it can result in improving computation speed that
   computational burden is reduced after simplifying lateral dynamic
   models. With the estimated information above mentioned, sideslip angle
   is also estimated well. The estimated information on tire cornering
   stiffness and sideslip angle is benefit to the design of lateral
   stability control system, which can make vehicle adapt to different road
   conditions and control the steering motion attitude of vehicle in future

   unstable GRNs with oscillatory behavior. Currently available approaches
   are conservative due to presence of nonlinear terms, which should be
   dealt with. In addition, nonlinear terms are only known approximately in
   practice and therefore previous works may lead to undesirable
   performance. To address conservativeness issue, we have provided an LPV
   approach. Besides, to diminish effects of uncertain nonlinear terms on
   observer performance, a peak-to-peak state estimation problem is
   considered. By defining appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional,
   sufficient conditions are derived that guarantee the desirable
   performance. The superiority of the proposed method to existing

   good performance of state estimation in presence of uncertainty is

AB This paper addresses the output feedback tracking control problem of
   electrically driven wheeled mobile robots subjected to actuator
   constraints. The main drawback of previously proposed controllers is the
   actuator saturation problem, which degrades the transient performance of
   the closed-loop control system. In order to alleviate this problem, a
   saturated tracking controller has been proposed using the hyperbolic
   tangent function. A new nonlinear observer is introduced in order to
   leave out the velocity sensors in the robot system to decrease the cost
   and weight of the system for practical applications. A dynamic surface
   control strategy is effectively used to reduce the design complexity
   when considering actuator dynamics. In addition, neural network
   approximation capabilities and adaptive robust techniques are also
   adopted to improve the tracking performance in the presence of uncertain
   nonlinearities and unknown parameters. Semi-global stability of the
   closed-loop system is presented using direct Lyapunov method. Simulation
   results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed
   control system for a differential drive mobile robot in practice.

AB A robust passive non-linear observer, utilizing the sliding mode concept
   and acceleration feedback (AFB) technique, is developed for ships. The
   main advantage of the proposed observer is that it is robust and that it
   takes the Coriolis-centripetal matrix (C-matrix) into account. The
   observer reconstructs velocities of ships and bias from slowly varying
   environmental disturbances. It also filters out the noise and wave
   frequency data from measurements to protect the actuators from wear and
   excessive fuel consumption. The sliding mode technique is introduced to
   improve robust performance against neglected disturbances,
   uncertainties, and unmodeled dynamics. The acceleration feedback
   technique and coordinate transformation are used for reshaping the
   inertia matrix and removing the C-matrix from the mathematical model.
   Then, the observer design and stability analysis become simpler. An
   output feedback controller using observer backstepping and the Lyapunov
   redesign technique is derived, and the global stability of the observer
   and observer-controller system is shown by Lyapunov stability theory. A
   set of simulations was carried out to verify the performance of the
   proposed observer and controller.

   are relaxed. The stability analysis is drawn by using a more general
   type of Lyapunov functional, where design parameters can be tuned to set
   the time-varying gain. A new design method based on such a Lyapunov
   functional is proposed to construct the observer. Simulation results
   affirm the effectiveness of the increasing-gain approach as compared

AB The problem of stabilizing steady gliding is critical for an underwater
   glider, which is subject to many non-negligible disturbances from the
   aquatic environment. In this paper, we propose a new systematic
   controller design and implementation approach for the stabilization
   problem, including a nonlinear, passivity-based controller and a
   nonlinear model-based observer, where the actuation is realized through
   a whale tail-like control surface. The controller is designed based on
   an approximation of a reduced model that is obtained through singular
   perturbation analysis, and consequently, it does not require full state
   feedback. The local stability of the full closed-loop system is
   established through linearization analysis. The nonlinear observer is
   designed to estimate the velocity-related system states, which are
   difficult to measure for such low-speed underwater vehicles. Simulation
   results are first provided to demonstrate that the proposed controller
   achieves rapid convergence in stabilization and the proposed observer
   has good performance especially in robustness against measurement noise.
   Experimental results using a gliding robotic fish are presented to
   support the effectiveness of both the controller and the observer.

   proposed to identify the parameter of satellite's thruster misalignment
   angles. The satellite considered is represented by Euler angles. As the
   finite available data is met for on-orbital satellite, the proposed
   approach is designed by using the techniques of nonlinear observer and
   data-driven solution simultaneously. As a stepping stone, a terminal
   sliding-mode observer is developed to estimate the deviation torque
   introduced by thruster misalignment. It is shown by Lyapunov stability
   analysis that, precise estimation with zero error is guaranteed with
   finite-time convergence. Based on such estimated value, a data-driven

AB This brief presents a contribution to nonlinear observer design for both
   the estimation of vehicle lateral dynamics and road curvature. The
   latter is recovered by a simple algebraic technique and high-order
   sliding mode differentiator, which allows to estimate exactly the time
   derivatives of measured signals. For the lateral dynamics of the
   vehicle, a new approach is developed by the use of a Takagi-Sugeno (TS)
   model representing exactly, with no loss of information, the nonlinear
   vehicle behavior in a compact set of the state space. The TS model
   involves unmeasured premise variables. The proposed new observer starts
   with the estimation of these premise variables. Second, the design of an
   observer with weighting functions depending on these estimated premise
   variables is considered. Theoretically, the proposed observer ensures
   exponential convergence of the state estimation error toward zero. This
   convergence is studied by the Lyapunov theory and the obtained stability
   conditions are expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities.
   Finally, experimental results are given for vehicle lateral dynamics and

AB This paper proposes an internal model principle (IMP)-based robust
   optimal nonlinear control with observer for position tracking of
   surface-mounted permanent magnet synchronous motor servo systems. We
   provide the control method to reject offset errors and load torque for
   designing field-oriented control (FOC) based on an alternating current
   (AC) frame. The proposed method consists of a torque generator, a
   commutation scheme, a electrical controller, and a nonlinear observer.
   The torque generator consists of a mechanical controller and an IMP
   controller. The mechanical controller is designed to compensate for the
   load torque and the offset error and generate the desired torque. The
   IMP controller is augmented to reject the position ripple. The
   commutation scheme is proposed to generate the desired currents for the
   desired torque. The electrical controller is developed to compensate for
   DC offset error and to guarantee the desired currents. The nonlinear
   observer is designed to estimate both velocity and load torque. In order
   to get the robustness to parameter uncertainties and the gain-tuning
   guideline, the linear quadratic regulator method is embedded in the
   proposed method. The closed-loop stability is proven using
   input-to-state stability. The detailed process for FOC design and the
   analysis of the control method based on an AC frame are presented. The
   performance of the proposed method was validated via experiments.

   the 6-dof parallel hydraulic manipulator (Stewart platform) while
   incorporating an observer-based forward kinematics solver. Different
   from conventional control methods, the proposed control considers not
   only the platform dynamics but also the dynamics of the hydraulic
   actuator. One feature of this work is employing the observer-based
   forward kinematics solution to achieve the posture tracking goal
   successfully only with the measurement of actuators lengths. When
   designing the controller of hydraulic actuators, the friction
   compensation is applied to improve the performance. The stability of the
   whole system is thoroughly proved to ensure convergence of the control
   errors. Simulations and experimental results are presented to validate
   the hereby proposed results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A novel adaptive nonlinear observer-based parameter estimation scheme
   using a newly continuously differentiable friction model has been
   developed to estimate the tire-road friction force. The differentiable
   friction model is more flexible and suitable for online adaptive
   identification and control with the advantage of more explicit
   parameterizable form. Different from conventional estimation methods,
   the filtered regression estimation parameter is introduced in the novel
   adaptive laws, which can guarantee that both the observer error and
   parameter error exponentially converge to zero. Lyapunov theory has been
   used to prove the stability of the proposed methods. The effectiveness
   of the estimation algorithm is illustrated via a bus simulation model in
   the Trucksim software and simulation environment. The relatively
   accurate tire-road friction force was estimated just by the easily
   existing sensors signals wheel rotational speed and vehicle speed and
   the proposed method also displays strong robustness against bounded

AB This paper presents a novel nonlinear observer-design approach to
   one-sided Lipschitz nonlinear systems in the presence of output delays.
   The crux of the approach is to overcome the practical consequences of
   time delays, encountered due to distant sensor position and time lag in
   measurement, for estimation of physical and engineering nonlinear system
   states. A Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is employed, the time
   derivative of which is solved using Jensen's inequality, one-sided
   Lipschitz condition, and quadratic inner-boundedness, and, accordingly,
   design conditions for delay-range-dependent nonlinear observer for
   delayed one-sided Lipschitz systems are derived. Further, novel
   solutions to the problems of delay-dependent observer synthesis of
   one-sided Lipschitz models and delay-range-dependent state estimation of
   linear and Lipschitz nonlinear systems are deduced from the present
   delay-range-dependent technique. An observer formulation methodology for
   retrieval of one-sided Lipschitz nonlinear-system states, which is
   robust against.. 2 norm-bounded perturbations, is devised. The resultant
   design conditions, in contrast to the conventional procedures, can be
   solved via less conservative linear matrix inequality-(LMI-) based
   routines that succeed by virtue of additional LMI variables, meaningful
   transformations, and cone complementary linearization algorithm.
   Numerical examples are worked out to illustrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed observer-synthesis approach for delayed one-sided Lipschitz
   systems.

   topological obstructions to global stability by not confining the
   attitude estimate to SO(3), but rather estimating a full rotation matrix
   with nine degrees of freedom. We also show how the attitude can be
   estimated under a relaxed persistency-of-excitation condition, with a
   single vector measurement as a special case. Next, we use the attitude
   observer to construct a globally exponentially stable observer for
   GNSS/INS integration, based on accelerometer, gyro, and magnetometer
   measurements, as well as GNSS measurements of position and (optionally)
   velocity. We verify the stability properties of the design using

AB The state of charge (SOC) is important for the safety and reliability of
   battery operation since it indicates the remaining capacity of a
   battery. However, as the internal state of each cell cannot be directly
   measured, the value of the SOC has to be estimated. In this paper, a
   novel method for SOC estimation in electric vehicles (EVs) using a
   nonlinear observer (NLO) is presented. One advantage of this method is
   that it does not need complicated matrix operations, so the computation
   cost can be reduced. As a key step in design of the nonlinear observer,
   the state space equations based on the equivalent circuit model are
   derived. The Lyapunov stability theory is employed to prove the
   convergence of the nonlinear observer. Four experiments are carried out
   to evaluate the performance of the presented method. The results show
   that the SOC estimation error converges to 3% within 130 s while the
   initial SOC error reaches 20%, and does not exceed 4.5% while the
   measurement suffers both 2.5% voltage noise and 5% current noise.
   Besides, the presented method has advantages over the extended Kalman
   filter (EKF) and sliding mode observer (SMO) algorithms in terms of
   computation cost, estimation accuracy and convergence rate. (C) 2014

   the joint velocities are unknown and unmeasured. First, a fuzzy adaptive
   nonlinear observer is presented to estimate the joint velocities of

   positive real approach and Lyapunov stability theory. Next, based on the
   observed joint velocities, a fuzzy adaptive output feedback controller
   is developed to guarantee stability of closed-loop system and achieve a
   certain tracking performance. Based on the Lyapunov stability theorem,
   it is proved that all the signals in closed-loop system are bounded.
   Finally, simulation examples on a two-link robotic manipulator are

   vehicles (ROVs)-unmanned, tethered robots commonly used for underwater
   commercial and scientific tasks. These methods exploit knowledge of the
   vehicle's nonlinear dynamics, the forces and moments acting on the
   vehicle, and disparate position and velocity measurements. The position
   and velocity of the ROV are estimated using two methods: 1) a nonlinear
   observer (NLO) and 2) an extended Kalman filter (EKF). The NLO is
   derived and its stability proven using Lyapunov techniques. A
   high-precision 300-kHz acoustic positioning system provided a ground
   truth for the laboratory experiments and our results show that both the
   NLO and EKF position estimates possess lower standard deviations than
   the measurements from conventional 12-kHz long-baseline systems. A
   dynamic model sensitivity analysis is included for the laboratory
   experiments. Field experiments obtained with the Jason2 ROV at 2300-m
   depth demonstrate that the NLO and EKF work in the field. These
   experiments are, to the best of our knowledge, the first reported
   experiments of an NLO and EKF using a nonlinear model of ROV dynamics.
   The performance of the NLO and EKF are compared using the criteria of
   convergence, accuracy, precision, parameter sensitivity, and robustness
   to velocity measurement outages, and our results show that the NLO
   provides superior performance. The impact of these results includes more
   robust state estimation for underwater robots and an increased operating
   range that will provide new capabilities.

AB The state of charge (SOC) is important for the safety and reliability of
   battery operation since it indicates the remaining capacity of a
   battery. However, it is difficult to get an accurate value of SOC,
   because the SOC cannot be directly measured by a sensor. In this paper,
   an adaptive gain nonlinear observer (AGNO) for SOC estimation of
   lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in electric vehicles (EVs) is proposed. The
   second-order resistor-capacitor (2RC) equivalent circuit model is used
   to simulate the dynamic behaviors of a LIB, based on which the state
   equations are derived to design the AGNO for SOC estimation. The model
   parameters are identified using the exponential-function fitting method.
   The sixth-order polynomial function is used to describe the highly
   nonlinear relationship between the open circuit voltage (OCV) and the
   SOC. The convergence of the proposed AGNO is proved using the Lyapunov
   stability theory. Two typical driving cycles, including the New European
   Driving Cycle (NEDC) and Federal Urban Driving Schedule (FUDS) are
   adopted to evaluate the performance of the AGNO by comparing with the
   unscented Kalman filter (UKF) algorithm. The experimental results show
   that the AGNO has better performance than the UKF algorithm in terms of
   reducing the computation cost, improving the estimation accuracy and
   enhancing the convergence ability.

   waste gas to generate power. The system is modelled as a standard
   utility boiler using one known and one unknown (waste) fuel input.
   Standard linear controls have trouble dealing with large variations in
   the waste input, and in practice boiler shutdowns can occur. In this
   work, a nonlinear adaptive control design accounts for uncertainty in
   the plant parameters, and an adaptive neural-network estimates the
   effect of the waste input. Since a linear observer design cannot
   guarantee convergence away from a set point, a novel nonlinear observer
   design provides estimates of the states. The observer design uses
   fictitious states to estimate nonlinear terms in the observer dynamics.
   The analysis guarantees Lyapunov stability, thus the observer bounds
   depend on the accuracy of the observer initial conditions. Simulation
   results show the proposed method can obtain accurate performance and
   stability, improving over results obtained withproportional-integral
   control.

   transforms the model into a reduced-order linear one with an autonomous
   dynamical part. Then a linear state feedback stabilizing controller is
   designed for the reduced-order linear power system model using optimal
   control theory which enhances the stability of the entire system. The
   states of the feedback stabilizing controller are obtained from the
   nonlinear observer and the performance of this observer-based controller
   is independent of the operating points of power systems. The performance

AB This note is concerned with the observer design problem for a class of
   nonlinear neutral systems with time delay. The problem addressed is to
   design a full-order observer that guarantees the asymptotic stability of
   an error dynamic system. Firstly, some sufficient conditions for the
   existence of observers of a class of nonlinear neutral systems with
   time-varying delay are presented. An effective algebraic matrix equation
   approach is developed. Then we give a design method of the observer that
   is dependent on the solution of a linear matrix inequality. Furthermore,
   robust observer designs for a class of nonlinear neutral systems with
   time delay and uncertainties are obtained. Finally, an example is given
   to show the effectiveness of our proposed approaches.

AB In this work, we focus on distributed moving horizon estimation (DMHE)
   of nonlinear systems subject to time-varying communication delays. In
   particular, a class of nonlinear systems composed of subsystems
   interacting with each other via their states is considered. In the
   proposed design, an observer-enhanced moving horizon state estimator
   (MHE) is designed for each subsystem. The distributed MHEs exchange
   information via a shared communication network. To handle communication
   delays, an open-loop state predictor is designed for each subsystem to
   provide predictions of unavailable subsystem states (due to delays).
   Based on the predictions, an auxiliary nonlinear observer is used to
   generate a reference subsystem state estimate for each subsystem. The
   reference subsystem state estimate is used to formulate a confidence
   region for the actual subsystem state. The MHE of a subsystem is only
   allowed to optimize its subsystem state estimate within the
   corresponding confidence region. Under the assumption that there is an
   upper bound on the time-varying delays, the proposed DMHE is proved to
   give decreasing and ultimately bounded estimation error. The theoretical
   results are illustrated via the application to a reactor-separator
   chemical process. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An adaptive nonlinear observer design for the planar solid oxide fuel
   cell (SOFC) is presented in this work. This observer is based on a
   lumped parameter model of the SOFC and it can simultaneously estimate
   the inputs and the states of the system. Considering the inputs as
   unknown parameters is advantageous because some of the input parameters
   are not practically measurable in a SOFC stack. The asymptotic stability
   of the proposed observer is proven using the Lyapunov function method
   and is based on the concept of input-to-state stability for cascaded
   systems. The simulations show that the developed observer can track the
   temperature and species concentration profiles in the planar SOFC during
   step changes in the input variables and can simultaneously predict the
   input variables. The adaptive observer presented is valid for a wide
   operating range, requires fewer variables to be measured, and is robust
   to fluctuations in the input variables. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

AB Real-time estimation of the equivalent grid impedance and the equivalent
   grid voltage seen from a power converter connected to the public
   electric distribution network by means of extended Kalman filter is
   addressed. The theoretical background of the extended Kalman filter used
   for equivalent grid impedance estimation is introduced. Practical
   aspects like the use of the filter in an environment with highly
   distorted voltage waveforms, the tuning of the noise covariance
   matrices, and the implementation on a laboratory system are discussed.
   The theoretical analysis is verified on a 22-kW test-bench where a grid
   impedance emulator is used to simulate grid impedance steps in the
   laboratory environment. The proposed extended Kalman filter is designed
   to utilize the noise that is already present at the connection point of
   the power converter to overcome the need of active disturbance injection
   to estimate the equivalent grid impedance. Thus, electrical equipment
   connected close to the grid-connected converter is only affected
   marginally by the equivalent grid impedance estimation technique.

   vehicle velocities estimation based on vehicle dynamics and Unified
   Exponential tire model. Yaw rate is chosen to construct the
   reduced-order observer since it can be conceived as the function of
   vehicle velocities. The observer is designed such that the error
   dynamics system is input-to-state stability (ISS), where model errors
   including mass and CoG variation, and estimation or measurement error of
   the maximum tire-road friction coefficient are considered as additive
   disturbance inputs. Then, the condition of the observer gain satisfied
   is obtained by the ISS analysis and the lower observer gain is obtained
   through the convex optimisation described by the linear matrix
   inequalities. The proposed observer requires fewer tuning parameters and
   thus indicates an easier implementation compared with the existing
   extended Kalman filter. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness
   of the proposed reduced-order non-linear observer, which is also
   validated through experimental data from Hongqi vehicle HQ430.
   Furthermore, its computational efficiency is shown based on the

   quaternion-based nonlinear observer is proposed in order to fuse all
   information sources and to obtain an accurate estimation of the
   attitude. It is shown that the observer error dynamics can be separated
   into two passive subsystems connected in "feedback". Then, this property
   is used to show that the error dynamics is input-to-state stable when
   the measurement disturbance is seen as an input and the error as the
   state. These results allow one to affirm that the observer is "robustly
   stable". The proposed observer is evaluated in real-time with the design
   and implementation of an Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS)
   based on low-cost MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) Inertial
   Measure Unit (IMU) and magnetic sensors and a 16-bit microcontroller.
   The resulting estimates are compared with a high precision motion system

AB The problem of designing an observer for nonlinear Lipschitz systems
   affected by system and sensor noises is addressed. Related to the system
   nonlinearity, the stability of observer dynamic with static and dynamic
   gain is considered. The advantage of using dynamic gain to deal with
   large Lipschitz nonlinearity is discussed and it is proved that no
   dynamic gain can stabilise the observer for a larger Lipschitz constant
   as compared with the static gain. However, a nonlinear observer with
   dynamic gain has some additional degrees of freedom which can be
   utilised to attenuate noise effect on the observer behaviour. Using
   mixed and criteria, this article introduces a method to obtain a dynamic
   gain which can deal with system nonlinearity and noise simultaneously.
   The effectiveness of the proposed method is finally demonstrated by some
   simulation results.

AB Although there have been some severe nuclear accidents such as Three
   Mile Island (USA), Chernobyl (Ukraine) and Fukushima (Japan), nuclear
   fission energy is still a source of clean energy that can substitute for
   fossil fuels in a centralized way and in a great amount with commercial
   availability and economic competitiveness. Since the pressurized water
   reactor (PWR) is the most widely used nuclear fission reactor, its safe,
   stable and efficient operation is meaningful to the current rebirth of
   the nuclear fission energy industry. Power-level regulation is an
   important technique which can deeply affect the operation stability and
   efficiency of PWRs. Compared with the classical power-level controllers,
   the advanced power-level regulators could strengthen both the
   closed-loop stability and control performance by feeding back the
   internal state-variables. However, not all of the internal state
   variables of a PWR can be obtained directly by measurements. To
   implement advanced PWR power-level control law, it is necessary to
   develop a state-observer to reconstruct the unmeasurable
   state-variables. Since a PWR is naturally a complex nonlinear system
   with parameters varying with power-level, fuel burnup, xenon isotope
   production, control rod worth and etc., it is meaningful to design a
   nonlinear observer for the PWR with adaptability to system
   uncertainties. Due to this and the strong learning capability of the
   multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network, an MLP-based nonlinear
   adaptive observer is given for PWRs. Based upon Lyapunov stability
   theory, it is proved theoretically that this newly-built observer can
   provide bounded and convergent state-observation. This observer is then
   applied to the state-observation of a special PWR, i.e., the nuclear
   heating reactor (NHR), and numerical simulation results not only verify
   its feasibility but also give the relationship between the observation
   performance and observer parameters.

   They are involved in the production of high value compounds and also
   have applications in energy production. In this work, the regulation of

   to operate in a constant biomass concentration mode, in order to
   maintain the culture at a desired concentration and to sustain high

   nonlinear Lipschitz observer is proposed. On the basis of the Droop
   model, which describes the dynamic behavior of the microalgae process
   and based on the biomass measurements, the stability of the state error
   dynamics can be guarnateed. Finally, simulations and comparisons with a

   tool for system identification and pattern recognition whereas here AIS
   is utilized as an online approximator in discrete-time (OLAD) in a fault
   detection (FD) observer. A fault is detected when the output residual
   exceeds a predefined threshold. Upon detection, the OLAD is initiated to
   learn the unknown fault dynamics online while the robust adaptive term
   ensure asymptotic convergence of the output residual for a state fault
   whereas a bounded result for an output fault. Additionally, a
   mathematical equation is introduced to estimate the time-to-failure
   (TTF) by using the output residual and the estimated fault parameters.
   Finally, the performance of the proposed FDP scheme is demonstrated on

AB This paper considers a class of nonlinear descriptor systems whose
   nonlinear terms are time-varying and satisfy a quadratic inequality. An
   nonlinear observer is constructed and the error system is represented by
   a Lur'e descriptor system (LDS). Motivated by the basic idea of absolute
   stability theory, both types of full-order and reduced-order observers
   are constructed by a unified approach. The proposed method generalizes
   the existing ones for standard state-space systems, and global
   convergence of the nonlinear observer is achieved without the usual
   global Lipschitz restriction. Furthermore, the stability criterion for
   the error system extends the existing ones for LDS in the sense that the
   involved interconnected nonlinearities are time-varying and in unbounded
   sector. Finally, the design methods are reduced to a linear matrix
   inequality problem and illustrated by two numerical examples. Copyright

AB In this work, a robust moving horizon estimation scheme augmented by an
   auxiliary nonlinear observer is proposed for nonlinear systems with
   bounded model uncertainties. Specifically, an auxiliary deterministic
   nonlinear observer that asymptotically tracks nominal system state is
   taken advantage of to calculate a confidence region that contains the
   actual system state taking into account the effects of bounded model
   uncertainties at every sampling time. This region is then used to design
   a constraint on the state estimates in the proposed moving horizon
   estimation. The proposed design brings together deterministic and
   optimization-based observer design techniques. First, the proposed
   moving horizon estimation scheme is proved to give bounded estimation
   errors in the case of bounded model uncertainties. Second, the proposed
   approach provides another option to compromise the effects of errors in
   arrival cost approximations and can be used together with different
   arrival cost approximation techniques to further improve the state
   estimate. The applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach
   is demonstrated through the application to two chemical process
   examples. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   adopts the RFLS to approximate nonlinear unknown functions and the
   nonlinear observer is established to estimate the unmeasured derivative
   states. Based on the Lyapunov stability approach, the update laws of
   RFLS are obtained and the stability of the closed-loop system is
   guaranteed. Finally, our approach is applied in tracking control of a
   two-input-two-output system and two-link manipulator robot system.

   tire-road friction is an effective measure of the safety margin of
   vehicle dynamics. For vehicle handling dynamics, the frictional
   coefficient is highly coupled with tire slip angle, therefore, they need
   to be estimated simultaneously when the latter is not measured. This

   an output feedback sliding mode control. The conventional forward
   kinematics solutions take too much computational load or are too complex
   to be carried out in the online control scheme. The proposed nonlinear
   observer-based algorithm provides a simple method to obtain a real-time
   forward kinematics solution. With this solution, 6-degrees-of-freedom
   posture control of the moving platform can be achieved without
   installation of any external sensor after applying an output feedback
   control. In contrast with the conventional control scheme which aims to
   control individual leg length in actuator domain, the output feedback
   controller is proposed here to control the posture in Cartesian domain
   directly. The stability of the whole system is thoroughly proved to
   ensure convergence of the control errors. Simulations and experimental
   results are presented to validate the feasibility of the hereby proposed

   principle and stability of microstepping are shown using the Lyapunov
   method. The Lyapunov-based controller is developed in order to guarantee
   the desired current of microstepping for the improvement of the position
   tracking. The passive nonlinear observer is designed to estimate the

   to tune the observer gain for the PMSM. The observer gain tuning is
   simple and intuitive using the passivity theorem. Using a passive

AB The problem of tracking a desired plasma glucose evolution is
   considered, for cases of basal hyperglycemia. A time-delay model is used
   to describe the glucose insulin regulatory system, aiming to detail the
   endogenous pancreatic insulin release, which is not negligible in Type 2
   diabetic patients. Insulin is assumed to be administered by means of
   intra-venous infusions. Only measurements of glycemia are considered: to
   this aim a nonlinear observer for time-delay systems is used to estimate
   the plasma insulin concentration. In the spirit of the separation
   theorem, a nonlinear control law is proposed, based on the exact
   input/output feedback linearization, which makes use of the observer
   estimates instead of the full state measurements. The local convergence
   of the tracking error to zero is theoretically proved. Simulations are
   performed in a virtual environment, taking into account the standard
   technology concerning blood glucose sensors and insulin delivery
   devices. Numerical results show the robustness of the proposed approach
   with respect to the uncertainties of the model parameters, as well as to
   the glucose measurement errors and insulin pump malfunctioning.

   to adapt an observer based controller devoted to render the closed-loop

AB Control and operation of electric networks undergo several changes due
   to growing energy coming from renewable sources and demanding power
   quality standards. New dynamic load features also pose a challenge to
   grid designers. In addition, economic reasons, an increasing demand and
   remote generation push transmission lines to their stability limits
   causing oscillation modes to become more lightly damped. In this
   context, controllers and devices are used to enhance the performance of
   the new power systems. In this work, an observer-based controller to
   improve stability in power systems, by using the excitation of
   synchronous generators, is introduced. The strategy goal is to attain
   maximum damping injection and to increase the transient stability, while
   good voltage regulation performance is maintained. The proposed strategy
   presents two important features from the implementation point of view.
   First, the controller only needs sensing currents and rotor speed, and
   second, previous knowledge of network parameters and topology is not
   required. Several comparisons in multi-machine scenarios with current
   power system stabilizers are presented. These studies confirm the
   viability and the performance improvement when conventional solutions
   are replaced by the proposed approach. (C) 2012 Elsevier BM. All rights

   The extension consists in adding the integrator to the controller for
   improving steady state performance of the control system. Stability of
   the control system including the observer dynamics is guaranteed, thanks

   for a nonlinear three degrees-of-freedom (3-DOF) parallel kinematic

   availability (only the moving platform displacement measurements are
   assumed available). Unknown velocity signals are estimated via a
   nonlinear robust observer that is designed for the nonlinear system with
   observable linear dynamics part and bounded nonlinearities and
   disturbances, and that guarantees global exponential stability of the
   observation error. A proportional-derivative (PD) controller is designed
   to solve the position control problem, utilizing the estimated velocity,
   as well as the gravitation compensation, dynamic friction and external
   disturbance compensation for the PKM. The closed-loop system is proven

   observation error to zero when the upper bounds on the model

   we utilize a novel simplified rational tire model to compute the lateral
   wheel forces. This tire model is significantly simpler than the well
   known Magic Formula (in terms of the number of model parameters), yet it
   provides sufficient detail over a wide range of operating conditions for
   the purpose of estimating the sideslip angle. The input to the nonlinear
   observer are typical signals that are available within lateral stability
   control systems, which include vehicle speed, steer angle, lateral
   acceleration and yaw rate measurements. In our analysis, we assume the
   road friction to be a known parameter. We utilize a recent theorem from
   the literature and show that the suggested nonlinear state estimator is
   asymptotically stable for the case where the observer makes use of the
   exact tire model, is stable (in the sense of Lyapunov) providing
   uniformly bounded error dynamics for the case where it makes use the
   proposed rational tire model to approximate the exact tire model.
   Finally, we provide numerical simulations to demonstrate the efficacy of
   our nonlinear observer based estimation technique under varying road
   friction conditions.

   strategy for a multi-variables continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR). A
   new robust nonlinear observer is constructed to estimate the whole
   process state variables. The observer is coupled with a nonlinear
   controller, designed based on the input-output linearization for
   controlling the concentration and reactor temperature. The closed loop
   system is shown to be globally asymptotically stable based on Lyapunov
   arguments. Finally, computer simulations are developed for showing the

AB Control of induction motor due to its nonlinear property is one of the
   most popular research topics recently. Vector control based algorithms
   which are used for proper functioning estimate the rotor speed and
   magnetic flux. In many applications, flux and speed are estimated
   without using sensors. Thus, in these cases, it is necessary to obtain
   speed and flux by measuring voltage and current. In this paper, a
   nonlinear observer for estimating motor parameters based on Lyapunov
   function is presented. Using the Lyapunov theory, inputs regulating
   system and control system are earned which improve system performance.
   Simulation and experimental results are included to validate the
   effectiveness of the proposed control scheme under possible
   uncertainties and different reference trajectories. These results show
   the advantages of the proposed observer in control of induction motor
   transient performances. The merits of the proposed control system are
   also indicated comparing with a traditional optimal control system.

AB In active rollover prevention systems, a real-time rollover index, which
   indicates the likelihood of the vehicle to roll over, is used. This
   paper focuses on state and parameter estimation for reliable computation
   of the rollover index. Two key variables that are difficult to measure
   and play a critical role in the rollover index are found to be the roll
   angle and the height of the center of gravity of the vehicle. Algorithms
   are developed for real-time estimation of these variables. The
   algorithms investigated include a sensor fusion algorithm and a
   nonlinear dynamic observer. The sensor fusion algorithm requires a
   low-frequency tilt-angle sensor, whereas the dynamic observer utilizes
   only a lateral accelerometer and a gyroscope. The stability of the
   nonlinear observer is shown using Lyapunov's indirect method. The
   performance of the developed algorithms is investigated using
   simulations and experimental tests. Experimental data confirm that the
   developed algorithms perform reliably in a number of different maneuvers
   that include constant steering, ramp steering, double lane change, and
   sine with dwell steering tests.

AB Real-time knowledge of the slip angle in a vehicle is useful in many
   active vehicle safety applications, including yaw stability control,
   rollover prevention, and lane departure avoidance. Sensors that can
   directly measure slip angle are too expensive for ordinary automotive
   applications. This technical note develops a new nonlinear observer
   design technique for estimation of slip angle using inexpensive sensors
   normally available for yaw stability control applications. The approach
   utilized is to use the mean value theorem to express the nonlinear error
   dynamics as a convex combination of known matrices with time varying
   coefficients. A modified form of the mean value theorem for vector
   nonlinear systems is presented. The observer gains are then obtained by
   solving linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The developed approach can
   also enable observer design for a large class of differentiable
   nonlinear systems with a globally (or locally) bounded Jacobian. The
   developed nonlinear observer is evaluated through experimental tests on
   a Volvo XC90 sport utility vehicle. Detailed experimental results show
   that the developed nonlinear observer can reliably estimate slip angle
   for a variety of test maneuvers on road surfaces with different friction
   coefficients.

AB Currently most of control methods are of one degree of freedom (1-DOF)
   control structure for the robot systems which are affected by
   unmeasurable harmonic disturbances, at the same time in order to obtain
   perfect disturbance attenuation level, the controller gain must be
   increased. In practice, however, for robotic actuators, there are
   physical constraints that limit the amplitude of the available torques.
   This paper considers the problem of tracking control under input
   constraints for robot manipulators which are affected by unmeasurable
   harmonic disturbances. A new control scheme is proposed for the problem,
   which is composed of a parameter-dependent nonlinear observer and a
   tracking controller. The parameter-dependent nonlinear observer,
   designed based on the internal model principle, can achieve an
   estimation and compensation of a class of harmonic disturbances with
   unknown frequencies. The tracking controller, designed via adaptive
   control techniques, can make the systems asymptotically track the
   desired trajectories. In the control design, the continuous piecewise
   differentiable increasing function is used to limit control input
   amplitude, such that the control input saturation is avoided. The
   Lyapunov stability of closed loop systems is analyzed. To validate
   proposed control scheme, simulation results are provided for a two link
   horizontal robot manipulator. The simulation results show that the
   proposed control scheme ensures asymptotic tracking in presence of an
   uncertain external disturbance acting on the system. An important
   feature of the methodology consists of the fact that the designed
   controller is of 2-DOF control structure, namely, it has the ability to
   overcome the conflict between controller gain and robustness against
   external disturbances in the traditional 1-DOF control structure
   framework.

   The position and orientation of the camera is assumed to be measurable

AB Maximum load carrying capacity (MLCC) of flexible robot manipulators is
   computed based on closed-loop approach. In open-loop approach,
   controller is not considered, so the end effector deviation from the
   predefined path is significant and the accuracy constraint restrains the
   maximum payload before actuators go into saturation mode. In order to
   improve the MLCC, a method based on closed-loop strategy is presented.
   Since in this case the accuracy is improved the actuators constraint is
   not a major concern and full power of actuators can be used. Since
   controller can play an important role in improving the maximum payload,
   a sliding mode based partial feedback linearization controller is
   designed. Furthermore, a fuzzy variable layer is used in sliding mode
   design to boost the performance of the controller. However, the control
   strategy required measurements of elastic variables velocity that are
   not conveniently measurable. So a nonlinear observer is designed to
   estimate these variables. Stability analysis of the proposed controller
   and state observer are performed on the basis of Lyapunov's direct
   method. In order to verify the effectiveness of the presented method,
   simulation is done for a two-link flexible manipulator. The obtained
   maximum payload in open-loop and closed-loop cases is compared and the
   superiority of the method is illustrated and the results are discussed.

AB The performance of the vehicle dynamics stability control system(DSC) is
   dominated by the accurate estimation of tire forces in real-time. The
   characteristics of tire forces are determined by tire dynamic states and
   parameters, which vary in an obviously large scope along with different
   working conditions. Currently, there have been many methods based on the
   nonlinear observer to estimate the tire force and dynamic parameters,
   but they were only used in off-line analysis because of the computation
   complexity and the dynamics differences of four tires in the steering
   maneuver conditions were not considered properly. This paper develops a
   novel algorithm to observe tire parameters in real-time controller for
   DSC. The algorithm is based on the sensor-fusion technology with the
   signals of DSC sensors, and the tire parameters are estimated during a
   set of maneuver courses. The calibrated tire parameters in the control
   cycle are treated as the elementary states for vehicle dynamics
   observation, in which the errors between the calculated and the measured
   vehicle dynamics are used as the correcting factors for the tire
   parameter observing process. The test process with a given acceleration
   following a straight line is used to validate the estimation method of
   the longitudinal stiffness; while the test process with a given steering
   angle is used to validate the estimated value of the cornering
   stiffness. The ground test result shows that the proposed algorithm can
   estimate the tire stiffness accurately with an acceptable computation
   cost for real-time controller only using DSC sensor signal. The proposed
   algorithm can be an efficient algorithm for estimating the tire dynamic
   parameters in vehicle dynamics stability control system, and can be used
   to improve the robustness of the DSC controller.

   low-pass filtering. As a result the design has low-frequency disturbance
   rejection properties resulting from high-gain feedback but with a

   based on landmark readings and velocity measurements. A derivation of a
   nonlinear observer on SE(3) is presented, using a Lyapunov function
   conveniently expressed as a function of the difference between the
   estimated and the measured landmark coordinates. The resulting feedback
   laws are explicit functions of the landmark measurements and velocity
   readings, exploiting the sensor information directly in the observer.
   The proposed observer yields almost global asymptotic stabilization of
   the position and attitude errors and exponential convergence in any
   closed ball inside the region of attraction. Also, it is shown that the
   asymptotic convergence of the estimation error trajectories is shaped by
   the landmark geometry and observer design parameters. The problem of
   non-ideal velocity readings is also considered, and the observer is
   augmented to compensate for bias in the angular and linear velocity
   measurements. The resulting position, attitude, and bias estimation
   errors are shown to converge exponentially fast to the desired
   equilibrium points, for bounded initial estimation errors. Simulation
   results are presented to illustrate the stability and convergence
   properties of the observer. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   method for estimating the unknown parameters. The method applies to
   systems where the states are available for measurement, and
   perturbations with the property that an exponentially stable estimate of
   the unknown parameters can be obtained if the whole perturbation is
   known. The main contribution is to introduce a conceptually simple,
   modular design that gives freedom to the designer in accomplishing the
   main task, which is to construct an update law to asymptotically invert
   a nonlinear equation. Compensation for the perturbations in the system
   equations is considered for a class of systems with uniformly globally
   bounded solutions, for which the origin is uniformly globally
   asymptotically stable when no perturbations are present. We also
   consider the case when the parameters can only be estimated when the
   controlled state is bounded away from the origin, and show that we may
   still be able to achieve convergence of the controlled state. We
   illustrate the method through examples, and apply it to the problem of

AB This paper presents a novel smart MEMS accelerometer which employs a
   hybrid control algorithm and an estimator. This scheme is realized by
   adding a sliding-mode controller to a conventional PID closed loop
   system to achieve higher stability and higher dynamic range and to
   prevent pull-in phenomena by preventing finger displacement from passing
   a maximum preset value as well as adding an adaptive nonlinear observer
   to a conventional PID closed loop system. This estimator is used for
   online estimation of the parameter variations for MEMS accelerometers
   and gives the capability of self testing to the system. The analysis of
   convergence and resolution show that while the proposed control scheme
   satisfies these criteria it also keeps resolution performance better
   than what is normally obtained in conventional PID controllers. The
   performance of the proposed hybrid controller investigated here is
   validated by computer simulation.

AB In this paper, we consider the problem of autonomous underwater vehicle
   (AUV) station keeping (SK) in shallow water area. During SK, an AUV is
   required to maintain position and orientation with respect to a fixed
   reference point at the sea floor. When AUV operates in shallow water,
   high-frequency disturbances due to waves will significantly affect the
   motion of the AUV. In order to derive wave disturbance information for
   control purposes, a nonlinear observer is first designed to estimate the
   shallow water wave velocities and AUV relative velocities by using
   position and attitude measurement. Using the observer estimates, a
   nonlinear output feedback controller is subsequently synthesized by
   applying observer backstepping technique. Global exponential stability
   (GES) of the proposed nonlinear observer-controller design is proved
   through Lyapunov stability theory. Simulation studies on a model based
   on an actual AUV were performed to verify the performance of the
   proposed nonlinear observer and output feedback controller. Copyright

AB Identification of the probe height above the sample surface is a highly
   useful method to acquire atomic-resolution AFM images. Most AFM systems
   in non-contact mode use amplitude or phase measurement to identify the
   sample-probe distance and thereby the sample topography. However, this
   process is time consuming. For the purpose of sample height estimation
   in this paper we propose an adaptive nonlinear observer capable of
   high-precision probe height estimation within a small fraction of the
   probe transient motion. In addition, to maintain constant sample height
   at the set point level determined by the user during scanning and
   imaging in non-contact mode and achieve high rate data sampling, this
   paper develops a novel output state feedback controller. In this case,
   the surface topography image of the sample is created through the
   feedback signal which adjusts the vertical movements of the sample
   during scanning. The stability of the proposed observer and control
   method is proved by the Lyapunov stability analysis. Numerical
   simulations are employed to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness
   of the proposed scheme.

AB In biological research, experimental data analysis plays an important
   role since it enables quantitative understanding of biochemical
   processes. On the other hand, today's measurement techniques, in
   continuous development, generally allow measuring a subset of the major
   systems variables.
   Such major issue can be tackled by relying on a system's and
   mathematical approach. For instance, first principles modelling of
   metabolic or signal transduction networks typically leads to a set of
   nonlinear differential equations. In this paper, we devise a nonlinear
   observer specifically suited for models of biochemical reaction
   networks. We show that the observer is locally convergent under certain
   observability conditions which can be inferred by elementary network
   analysis.
   The applicability and performance of the outlined observer are shown
   considering the state estimation problem for a benchmark biochemical
   reaction network.

AB In this paper, an algorithm is proposed to improve the Maximum Load
   Carrying Capacity (MLCC) of flexible robot manipulators. The maximum
   allowable load which can be achieved by a flexible manipulator along a
   given trajectory is limited by the joints' actuator capacity and the end
   effector accuracy constraint. In art open-loop approach, the end
   effector deviation from the predefined path is significant and the
   accuracy constraint restrains the maximum payload before actuators go
   into saturation mode. By using a controller, the accuracy of tracking
   will improve. The actuator constraint is not a major concern and,
   therefore, the full power of the actuators, which leads to an increase
   in the Maximum Load Carrying Capacity, can be used. In this case, the
   controller can play an important role in improving the maximum payload,
   so a, robust controller is designed However. the control strategy
   requires measurement of the elastic variables velocity, which is not
   conveniently measurable. So, a nonlinear observer is designed to
   estimate these variables. A stability analysis of the proposed
   controller and state observer is performed on the basis of the Lyapunov
   Direct Method In order to verify the effectiveness of the presented
   method, simulation is done for a two link flexible manipulator. The
   obtained maximum payload for open and closed-loop cases is compared, and
   the superiority of the method is illustrated.

AB In this paper, a decentralized sliding-mode control approach is applied
   to the control tasks of vehicles in platoons. Using the well-known
   bicycle model, a robust nonlinear observer is introduced to facilitate
   the controller design, which needs full-state measurements. The vehicles
   in platoons can be treated as an interconnected system with a special
   form. Observer gain and controller gain are properly designed. In
   addition, appropriate linear matrix inequality (LMI) stability
   conditions by the Lyapunov method are derived to ensure the stability of
   the system. The main advantages can be summarized as follows: 1) The
   linear approximation of the nonlinear vehicle model enables various
   advanced robust control possibilities. 2) The proposed robust control
   approach with the nonlinear observer ensures the convergence of the
   whole interconnected system, given that the system is operated within
   the stable region of linearization. 3) Stability conditions in the form
   of LMIs for both observer and controller are rigorously derived.
   Finally, simulation results for three identical vehicles based on the
   relative bicycle model are demonstrated to show the performance of the
   approach.

   reconstruction speed and robustness to model uncertainty on the one hand
   versus amplification of noise on the other. Based on this tradeoff we
   propose a high-gain observer that switches between two gain values. This

   large class of functions of time as reference trajectories of the
   boundary output, though we focus in more detail on the special case of
   sinusoidal references. Since the Burgers equation is not globally
   controllable, the reference amplitudes cannot be arbitrarily large. We
   provide a sufficient condition that characterizes the allowable
   amplitudes and frequencies, under which the state trajectory is bounded
   and tracking is achieved. We then consider the problem of output
   feedback stabilization. We design a nonlinear observer for the Burgers
   equation that employs only boundary sensing. We employ its state
   estimates in an output feedback control law, which we prove to be
   locally stabilizing. The output feedback law is illustrated with
   numerical simulations of the closed-loop system.

AB In constructing a globally convergent numerical nonlinear observer of
   Newton-type for a continuous-time nonlinear system, a globally
   convergent nonlinear equation solver with a guaranteed rate of
   convergence is necessary. In particular, the solver should be Jacobian
   free, because an analytic form of the state transition map of the
   nonlinear system is generally unavailable. In this paper, two
   Jacobian-free nonlinear equation solvers of pseudo-Newton type that
   fulfill these requirements are proposed. One of them is based on the
   finite difference approximation of the Jacobian with variable step size
   together with the line search. The other uses a similar idea, but the
   estimate of the Jacobian is mostly updated through a BFGS-type law.
   Then, by using these solvers, globally stable numerical nonlinear
   observers are constructed. Numerical results are included to illustrate

AB In this paper an adaptive controller-observer temperature control scheme
   is developed for a class of irreversible non-chain reactions taking
   place in batch reactors. The scheme is based on a nonlinear observer for
   the estimation of the heat released by the reaction, where the heat
   transfer coefficient is adaptively estimated. Tracking of the desired
   reactor temperature is achieved via a two-loop control scheme, where an
   independent adaptive estimate of the heat transfer coefficient is used
   as well. Remarkably, the observer and the controller can be designed and
   tuned separately. The convergence of both the nonlinear observer and of
   the overall controller-observer scheme is analyzed by resorting to a
   Lyapunov-like argument. A comparative simulation case Study is developed
   to test the performance of the proposed scheme and compare it with other
   approaches already known in the literature. Copyright (C) 2007 John

AB Many applications require the interpretation of the Euclidean
   coordinates of features of a 3-D object through 2-D images. In this
   paper, the relative range and the Euclidean coordinates of an object or
   camera undergoing general affine motion are determined for
   paracatadioptric imaging systems via a nonlinear observer. The nonlinear
   observer asymptotically determines the range information provided that
   the motion parameters are known. The observer is developed through a
   Lyapunov-based design and stability analysis, and simulation results are
   provided that illustrate the performance of the state estimator. The
   contributions of this paper are that the developed observer: 1) can be
   applied to both affine and nonaffine systems; 2) can be used for both
   the fixed and moving camera configurations; 3) is continuous; and 4)
   yields an asymptotic result.

AB In this paper, an adaptive control scheme is proposed for the regulation
   problem of rigid-link flexible-joint (RLFJ) robots with uncertain
   kinematics. Existing research works in literature on RLFJ robot control
   assume exact knowledge of the kinematics of robot, and no result that
   can deal with kinematics uncertainty in RLFJ robot has been proposed so
   far. This paper presents the first study addressing this problem. The
   adaptive control scheme proposed can deal with the kinematics
   uncertainty and uncertainties in both link and actuator dynamics of the
   RLFJ robot system. A nonlinear observer is designed to avoid the use of
   acceleration due to the fourth-order overall dynamics. Asymptotic
   stability of the closed-loop system is shown and sufficient conditions
   are presented to guarantee the stability. Simulation results are
   provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method.

AB This paper considers the problem of obtaining good attitude estimates
   from measurements obtained from typical low cost inertial measurement
   units. The outputs of such systems are characterized by high noise
   levels and time varying additive biases. We formulate the filtering
   problem as deterministic observer kinematics posed directly on the
   special orthogonal group SO (3) driven by reconstructed attitude and
   angular velocity measurements. Lyapunov analysis results for the
   proposed observers are derived that ensure almost global stability of
   the observer error. The approach taken leads to an observer that we term
   the direct complementary filter. By exploiting the geometry of the
   special orthogonal group a related observer, termed the passive
   complementary filter, is derived that decouples the gyro measurements
   from the reconstructed attitude in the observer inputs. Both the direct
   and passive filters can be extended to estimate gyro bias online. The
   passive filter is further developed to provide a formulation in terms of
   the measurement error that avoids any algebraic reconstruction of the
   attitude. This leads to an observer on SO(3), termed the explicit
   complementary filter, that requires only accelerometer and gyro outputs;
   is suitable for implementation on embedded hardware; and provides good
   attitude estimates as well as estimating the gyro biases online. The
   performance of the observers are demonstrated with a set of experiments
   performed on a robotic test-bed and a radio controlled unmanned aerial
   vehicle.

AB This paper proposes a robust output feedback controller for a class of
   nonlinear systems to track a desired trajectory. Our main goal is to
   ensure the global input-to-state stability (ISS) property of the
   tracking error nonlinear dynamics with respect to the unknown structural
   system uncertainties and external disturbances. Our approach consists of
   constructing a nonlinear observer to reconstruct the unavailable states,
   and then designing a discontinuous controller using a back-stepping like
   design procedure to ensure the ISS property. The observer design is
   realized through state transformation and there is only one parameter to
   be determined. Through solving a Hamilton-Jacoby inequality, the
   nonlinear control law for the first subsystem specifies a nonlinear
   switching surface. By virtue of nonlinear control for the first
   subsystem, the resulting sliding manifold in the sliding phase possesses
   the desired ISS property and to certain extent the optimality.
   Associated with the new switching surface, the sliding mode control is
   applied to the second subsystem to accomplish the tracking task. As a
   result, the tracking error is bounded and the ISS property of the whole
   system can be ensured while the internal stability is also achieved.
   Finally, an example is presented to show the effectiveness of the
   proposed scheme. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB A methodology is presented for the design of integrated, model-based
   fault diagnosis and reconfigurable control systems for
   transport-reaction processes modeled by nonlinear parabolic partial
   differential equations (PDEs) with control constraints and actuator
   faults. The methodology brings together nonlinear feedback control,
   fault detection and isolation (FDI), and performance-based supervisory
   switching between multiple actuator configurations. Using an
   approximate, finite-dimensional model that captures the PDE's dominant
   dynamic modes, a stabilizing nonlinear feedback controller is initially
   designed for each actuator configuration, and its stability region is
   explicitly characterized in terms of the control constraints and
   actuator locations. To facilitate the fault diagnosis task, the
   locations of the control actuators are chosen in a way that ensures that
   the evolution of each dominant mode, in appropriately chosen
   coordinates, is excited by only one actuator. Then, a set of dedicated
   FDI filters, each replicating the fault-free behavior of a given state
   of the approximate system, are constructed. The choice of actuator
   locations ensures that the residual of each filter is sensitive to
   faults in only one actuator and decoupled from the rest, thus, allowing
   complete fault isolation. Finally, a set of switching rules are derived
   to orchestrate switching from the faulty actuators to healthy fall-backs
   in a way that preserves closed-loop stability and minimizes the
   closed-loop performance deterioration resulting from actuator faults.
   Precise FDI thresholds and control reconfiguration criteria that account
   for model reduction errors are derived to prevent false alarms when the
   reduced order model-based fault-tolerant control structure is
   implemented on the process. A singular perturbation formulation is used
   to link these thresholds with the degree of separation between the slow
   and fast eigenvalues of the spatial differential operator. The developed
   methodology is successfully applied to the problem of constrained,
   actuator fault-tolerant stabilization of an unstable steady-state of a
   representative diffusion-reaction process. (c) 2007 American Institute

   single-input/single-output nonlinear uncertain systems. The
   uncertainties are characterized by a state-dependent vector and a scalar
   disturbance/unknown input. The discrete-time model is derived through
   Taylor series expansion together with nonlinear state transformation. A
   design methodology that combines the discrete-time sliding mode (DSM)
   and a nonlinear observer design is adopted, and a strategy is developed
   to guarantee the convergence of the estimation error to a bound within
   the specified boundary layer. A relation between sliding mode gain and
   boundary layer is established for the existence of DSM, and the
   estimation is made robust to external disturbances and uncertainties.
   The unknown input or disturbance can also be estimated through the
   sliding mode. The conditions for the asymptotical stability of the
   estimation error are analysed. Application to a bioreactor is given and

AB This paper presents a model-based nonlinear feedback controller designed
   to regulate the crank angle at 50% fuel burned (theta(CA50)) for a
   gasoline homogeneous charge compression ignition engine model during
   load transitions'. The regulation of the combustion timing is based on
   manipulating the charge temperature through internal dilution,, which is
   achieved by controlling the lift of a secondary opening of the exhaust
   valve, also known as the rebreathing lift. The nonlinear feedback
   controller developed is based on a positive semidefinite Lyapunov
   function using a simplified control model which contains only the
   cycle-to-cycle temperature dynamics. The nonlinear feedback controller
   depends on measurement of the combustion timing theta(CA50) and
   estimation of the temperature at intake valve closing. Closed-loop
   simulation of the full-order engine model shows that the nonlinear
   feedback controller, along with a nonlinear observer, is able to
   regulate the combustion timing theta(CA50) by stabilizing the
   temperature dynamics during load transitions. The closed-loop system
   with the observer-based feedback controller is shown to be robust to
   some classes of model uncertainty and measurement noise through
   simulation and an estimate of the region of attraction.

   torque angle of the powertrain. The stability of the presented observer

   for three-dimensional (3-D) target tracking. First, using standard
   body-attached coordinate frames (the world frame, camera frame, and
   object frame), we represent the relative position and orientation
   between a moving target and a camera as an element of SE(3). Using this
   representation we derive a nonlinear observer to estimate the relative
   rigid body motion from the measured camera data. We then establish the
   relationship between the estimation error in a 3-D workspace and in the
   image plane. We show passivity of the dynamic visual feedback system by
   combining the passivity of both the visual feedback system and the
   manipulator dynamics which allows us to prove stability in the sense of
   Lyapunov for the full 3-D dynamic visual feedback system. The L(2)-gain
   performance analysis, which deals with the disturbance attenuation
   problem, is then considered via dissipative systems theory. Finally,
   experimental results are presented to verify the stability and L(2)-gain
   performance of the dynamic visual feedback system.

AB Piezo-positioning mechanisms are often used in high-precision
   positioning applications. Due to their materials, nonlinear hysteretic
   behavior is commonly observed in such mechanisms and can be described by
   a LuGre model. In this paper, we develop two robust adaptive
   backstepping control algorithms for piezo-positioning mechanisms. In the
   first scheme, we take the structure of the LuGre model into account in
   the controller design, if the parameters of the model are known. A
   nonlinear observer is designed to estimate the hysteresis force. In the
   second scheme, there is no apriori information required from these
   parameters and thus they can be allowed totally uncertain. In this case,
   the LuGre model is divided into two parts. While the unknown parameters
   of one part are incorporated with unknown system parameters for
   estimation, the effect of the other part is treated as a bounded
   disturbance. An update law is used to estimate the bound involving this
   partial hysteresis effect and the external load. For both schemes, it is
   shown that not only global stability is guaranteed by the proposed
   controller, but also both transient and asymptotic performances are
   quantified as explicit functions of the design parameters so that
   designers can tune the design parameters in an explicit way to obtain
   the required closed loop behavior.

AB The problem of implementing fault-tolerant control to nonlinear
   processes with input constraints subject to control actuator failures is
   considered, and an approach predicated upon the idea of integrating
   fault-detection, feedback and supervisory control is presented and
   demonstrated. To illustrate the main idea behind the proposed approach,
   availability of measurements of all the process state variables is
   initially assumed. For the processes under consideration, a family of
   candidate control configurations, characterized by different manipulated
   inputs, is first identified. For each control configuration, a
   Lyapunov-based controller that enforces asymptotic closed-loop stability
   in the presence of constraints, is designed, and the constrained
   stability region, associated with it, is explicitly characterized A
   fault-detection filter is used to compute the expected closed-loop
   behavior in the absence of faults. Deviations of the process states from
   the expected closed-loop behavior are used to detect faults. A switching
   policy is then derived, on the basis of the stability regions, to
   orchestrate the activation/deactivation of the constituent control
   configurations in a way that guarantees closed-loop stability in the
   event that a failure is detected. Often, in chemical process
   applications, not all state variables are available for measurement. To
   deal with the problem of lack of process state measurements, a nonlinear
   observer is designed to generate estimates of the states, which are then
   used to implement the state feedback controller and the fault-detection
   filter. A switching policy is then derived to orchestrate the
   activation/deactivation of the constituent control configurations in a
   way that accounts for the estimation error. Finally, simulation studies
   are presented to demonstrate the implementation and evaluate the
   effectiveness of the proposed fault-tolerant control scheme, as well as
   to investigate an application in the presence of uncertainty and
   measurement noise. (c) 2006 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

AB Recent designs for brake-by-wire systems use "resolvers" to provide
   accurate and continuous measurements for the absolute position and speed
   of the rotor of the electric actuators in brake callipers (permanent
   magnet DC motors). Resolvers are absolute-angle transducers that are
   integrated with estimator modules called "angle tracking observer" and
   together they provide position and speed measurements. Current designs
   for angle-tracking observers are unstable in applications with high
   acceleration and/or speed. In this paper, we introduce a new
   angle-tracking observer in which a closed-loop linear time-invariant
   (LTI) observer is integrated with a quadrature encoder. Finite-gain
   stability of the proposed design and its robustness to three different
   kinds of parameter variations are proven based on theorems of
   input-output stability in nonlinear control theory. In our experiments,
   we examined the performance of our observer and two other methods (a
   well-known LTI observer and an extended Kalman filter) to estimate the
   position and speed of a brake-by-wire actuator. The results show that
   because of the very high speed and acceleration of the actuator in this
   application, the LTI observer and Kalman filter cannot track the rotor
   position and diverge. In contrast, with a properly designed open-loop
   transfer function and selecting a suitable switching threshold, our
   proposed angle-tracking observer is stable and highly accurate in a
   brake-by-wire application.

   global convergence of uncertainty estimation. It is shown that, if a
   partial knowledge of exogenous system is available and the nonlinear
   uncertain system meet certain conditions, global stability and global

AB This paper proposes an observer-based method for adaptive nonlinear
   guidance considering line-of-sight (LOS) measurement. Previously, an
   adaptive nonlinear guidance law was proposed considering target maneuver
   and control loop dynamics. However, some feedback quantities such as
   higher-order LOS rate derivatives, Chwa and Choi, "Adaptive nonlinear
   guidance considering control loop dynamics", IEEE Transactions on
   Aerospace Electronic Syststems, are not directly measurable in this
   guidance law, and therefore these need to be estimated for more
   practical application. Accordingly, assuming the unavailable information
   as bounded time-varying uncertainties, an integrated guidance and
   control model is reformulated in normal form with respect to available
   states including target uncertainties and control loop dynamics. Then, a
   nonlinear observer is designed based on this integrated guidance and
   control model using only measured LOS rate. Finally, by using the
   estimates of states and uncertainties, an observer-based adaptive
   guidance law is proposed to guarantee the desired interception
   performance against maneuvering target. The proposed approach can be
   effectively used against target maneuver and the limited performance of
   control loop. The stability analyses and simulations of the proposed
   observer and guidance law are included to demonstrate the practical
   application of our scheme.

   network is a novel approach based on the modified backpropagation (BP)
   algorithm. An e-modification term is added to guarantee robustness of
   the observer. No strictly positive real (SPR) or any other strong

   aviation control. First, a class of High orders differentiator (HOD) is
   presented which can estimate differential and high order differentials
   of signal with higher accuracy. Through root-locus analysis and pole
   requirements, a simple structure with only one adjustable parameter is
   determined and the relation between the parameter and performance of the
   HOD is built. Stability and convergence of the proposed HOD are proved.
   Frequency characteristic analysis demonstrates that the HOD itself is a
   filter which can well holdback noises in signal and differentials.
   Second, using the fact that the states of nonlinear affine system just
   are the differentials up to n - 1 th order of the system output, and
   based on the HOD, we present a new adaptive observer which does not rely
   on the model function of the nonlinear affine system. Third, a type of
   robust high order differentials feedback controller is yielded based on
   the HOD, and the HOD also does not rely on the model of the controlled
   affine system. Lastly to illustrate, several simulation examples are
   given.

AB A control strategy is developed in order to keep processes based on the

   problem is treated in the context of Optimal Control for nonlinear
   systems subject to quadratic cost objectives. The original dynamics is
   shown to be accurately approximated by a bilinear model without
   increasing the dimension, so the state variables retain their physical
   meaning. Finite and infinite horizon optimal control strategies are
   developed, based on the Hamiltonian formalism, and introducing a novel
   approach for working on-line with generalized Riccati differential
   equations and the associated costate dynamics. When there exists a final
   penalty on the state deviation, then a first order quasilinear partial
   differential equation is discovered and solved for the Riccati matrix.
   The observability problem is also treated, since the natural state
   (electrode surface coverage) can not be measured continuously. The
   output variable (current density) is fed into a high-gain nonlinear
   observer based on Lyapunov's stability considerations. The whole

AB This paper describes the development of a navigation system for SIVA
   family of UAVs that incorporates measurements from low cost solid state
   IMU and magneto-resistive magnetometer, single receiver inexpensive GPS,
   and absolute and differential pressure transducers. The navigator is
   composed of three modules: an attitude estimator, a position and
   velocity estimator and a mission management module. All the UAV
   navigation, guidance, control and communication algorithms and processes
   run on a PC-104 Pentium I processor.
   The attitude estimator algorithm is a computationally-inexpensive
   nonlinear observer developed using Lyapunov theory that computes angular
   velocity corrections from two vector measurements: Earth's magnetic
   field and gravity, guaranteeing global Input to State Stability.
   The position and velocity estimator consists of a set of three static
   linear Kalman filters that correct the integration of local level
   components of acceleration with GPS, pressure derived altitude and
   airspeed measurements.
   The autonomous navigation is performed by means of pre-programmed
   mission data, composed by a set of mission elements which define the
   trajectory to guide the UAV through a safe path. Mission data, mission
   phases and ground control modes are managed by the mission management
   module. (c) 2005 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents, a secure digital communication system based on
   chaotic modulation. cryptography, and chaotic synchronization
   techniques. The proposed system consists of a Chaotic Modulator (CM), a
   Chaotic Secure Transmitter (CST), a Chaotic Secure Receiver (CSR) and a
   Chaotic Demodulator (CDM). The CM module incorporates a chaotic system
   and a novel Chaotic Differential Peaks Keying.(CDPK) modulation scheme
   to generate analog patterns corresponding to the input digital bits. The
   CST and CSR modules are designed such that a single scalar signal is
   transmitted in the public channel. Further-more, by giving certain
   structural conditions of a particular class of chaotic system, the CST
   and the nonlinear observer-based CSR with an appropriate observer gain
   are constructed to synchronize with each other. Those two slave systems
   are driven simultaneously by the transmitted signal and are designed to
   synchronize and generate appropriate cryptography keys for encryption
   and decryption purposes. In the CDM module. a nonlinear observer is
   designed to estimate the chaotic modulating system in the CM. A
   demodulation mechanism is then applied to decode the transmitted input
   digital bits. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated
   through the numerical simulation of an illustrative communication
   system. Synchronization between the chaotic circuits of the transmitter
   and receiver modules is guaranteed through the Lyapunov stability
   theorem. Finally, the security features of the proposed system in the
   event of attack by an intruder in either the time domain or the
   frequency domain are discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB In this paper a method to design observers for nonlinear systems is
   proposed. The basic idea is to decompose the system in a nonlinear part,
   that can be transformed into a nonlinear observer form, and a
   perturbation term connected in the feedback loop. In transformed
   coordinates the observer error becomes linear with a feedback
   perturbation. By using the dissipativity theory it is possible to design
   the observer gains so, that the closed loop is internally stable if some
   LMI-like conditions are satisfied. This method is very flexible and
   allows the design of nonlinear observers using exact linearization
   methods to a much bigger class of systems. The method is shown to be
   very general, since it includes (and generalizes) as special cases
   several observer design methods, as for example the exact error
   linearization method, the high-gain method, the circle criterion design
   method, and the design for Lipschitz nonlinear systems. The design is
   computationally simple in many cases, since it reduces to the solution
   of a feasibility LMI problem, for which highly efficient numerical
   methods are available. The method offers great flexibility in the
   design, since the particular properties of the nonlinearities call be
   characterized by means of one or several quadratic forms, i.e. supply
   rates. This feature can be used to design observers for systems with
   special properties in the nonlinearities.

AB The trajectory tracking of a large-displacement piezoelectric actuator
   (LDPA) using a nonlinear observer-based variable structure control (VSC)
   was developed. A mechanism of amplification using a double lever was
   first designed, fabricated, and tested. Subsequently, a nonlinear model
   for the LDPA was verified by sinusoidal response and system knowledge.
   Because not all of the states of the nonlinear model were available, a
   nonlinear state observer was employed to estimate the state (e.g.,
   velocity, hysteresis, excitation force, and its derivative). For
   tracking the trajectory dominant by a specific frequency, the reference
   model with desired amplitude and phase features was designed. The
   proposed control scheme contained a feedback linearization with variable
   structure controller, a reference model to assign the desired dynamics,
   and a nonlinear state observer to estimate the unavailable state. The
   VSC included the following two parts: equivalent control and switching
   control. The equivalent control using the signals from observer and
   reference model was constructed to obtain the desired control behavior.
   Due to the existence of hysteresis, disturbance, and estimation error,
   the tracking performance was often deprived. In this situation, the
   switching control was employed to ameliorate the robust performance. The
   stability of the overall system was then verified by Lyapunov stability
   theory so that the ultimately bounded tracking was accomplished.
   Experiments of the LDPA were carried out to verify the usefulness of the
   proposed control.

AB Precise regulation of span tension in web-handling machines is critical
   to ensure product quality. Elevated tension causes web fracture during
   operation; depressed or highly variable tension leads to irregular and
   unacceptable spool. Web-handling machines typically employ costly load
   cell sensors to measure span tension. This work investigates the use of
   nonlinear estimators or observers to provide cost-effective span tension
   estimates from system measurements. After presenting the dynamic
   equations of a web-handling machine, their structure is exploited to
   design a reduced-order, nonlinear observer with linear time-varying
   error dynamics. Exponential stability of the error dynamics is
   demonstrated. Performance of the estimator is experimentally compared
   with two, competing designs on a real web-handling machine. (C) 2004

AB In most nonlinear control systems, such as biochemical systems, only
   partial state variables can be reliably measured. Thus, there is a need
   to estimate the unavailable state variables. Further, to effectively
   monitor and operate the nonlinear process, a frequent estimation of
   those unavailable state variables is desired. However, in many cases,
   the measurable state variables usually can only be measured less
   frequently. Hence, multi-rate state estimation has received many
   attentions because it allows for using infrequently available
   measurements and it leads to considerable improvement in the estimation
   results. Many works implement the multi-rate estimator using the
   extended Kalman filters or nonlinear observers with numerical
   integration. However, numerical integration is a time-consuming process,
   and the convergence analysis of multi-rate state estimation was not
   addressed. This paper designs a multi-rate nonlinear estimator based on
   Taylor series expansion plus discrete-time nonlinear state
   transformation, and we analyze the condition for the asymptotical
   stability of the state estimation error. This paper applies the general
   results on the multi-rate state estimation to a class of biological
   systems. The comparative study between multi-rate and single-rate state
   estimation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.
   Although this work is motivated by the multi-rate state estimation of
   biological systems, the proposed scheme and the performed analysis have
   a larger applicability to many nonlinear systems. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this paper a solution to the output feedback control problem, that
   improves the transient stability properties, of a single machine
   infinite bus power system is proposed by designing a nonlinear observer
   that asymptotically recovers the unmeasurable states of the system. The
   structure of the closed-loop system is completed by considering an
   injection and damping assignment passivity-based controller for which
   its stability properties are well established under a state feedback
   setting. It is shown, by using Lyapunov arguments and as a consequence
   of the asymptotic stability properties of the closed-loop system, that
   the properties of the original state feedback controller are (also
   asymptotically) recovered. The output feedback design considers that
   both the load angle and the speed deviation of the machine are
   measurable and that the mechanical power delivered to the synchronous
   generator is constant and known, assumptions that allow to treat
   uncertainty on the operating (equilibrium) point of the system in a
   simple way. The theoretical results are illustrated via numerical

AB The concept of the slow invariant manifold is recognized as the central
   idea underpinning a transition from micro to macro and model reduction
   in kinetic theories. We present the Constructive Methods of Invariant
   Manifolds for model reduction in physical and chemical kinetics,
   developed during last two decades. The physical problem of reduced
   description is studied in the most general form as a problem of
   constructing the slow invariant manifold. The invariance conditions are
   formulated as the differential equation for a manifold immersed in the
   phase space (the invariance equation). The equation of motion for
   immersed manifolds is obtained (the film extension of the dynamics).
   Invariant manifolds are fixed points for this equation, and slow
   invariant manifolds are Lyapunov stable fixed points, thus slowness is
   presented as stability.
   A collection of methods to derive analytically and to compute
   numerically the slow invariant manifolds is presented. Among them,
   iteration methods based on incomplete linearization, relaxation method
   and the method of invariant grids are developed. The systematic use of
   thermodynamics structures and of the quasi-chemical representation allow
   to construct approximations which are in concordance with physical
   restrictions.
   The following examples of applications are presented: nonperturbative
   deviation of physically consistent hydrodynamics from the Boltzmann
   equation and from the reversible dynamics, for Knudsen numbers Kn
   similar to 1; construction of the moment equations for nonequilibrium
   media and their dynamical correction (instead of extension of list of
   variables) to gain more accuracy in description of highly
   nonequilibrium, flows; determination of molecules dimension (as
   diameters of equivalent hard spheres) from experimental viscosity data;
   model reduction in chemical kinetics; derivation and numerical
   implementation of constitutive equations for polymeric fluids; the
   limits of macroscopic description for polymer molecules, etc. (C) 2004

   Lipschitz part is considered. The non-linear part satisfies the
   Lipschitz condition, whilst the uncertain part is a bounded function. A
   sliding mode observer is designed to yield feedforward compensation
   input to stabilize the error estimation system with and without a
   Lipschitz non-linearity. Sufficient conditions for stability of the Thau
   observer are also proposed. These conditions ensure the stability of the
   nonlinear observer by selecting a suitable observer gain matrix. In
   general, when the system contains unmatched uncertainty, ultimate
   boundedness is obtained. The ultimate boundedness radius depends upon
   the defined 'distance of the unmatched uncertainty'. Some sufficient
   conditions may ensure the stability of a non-linear observer for systems
   with uncertainties.

AB This brief paper presents an observer-based control approach for the
   acceleration control of tail-controlled skid-to-turn (STT) missiles. The
   proposed approach provides a solution to overcoming the drawbacks of
   existing nonlinear missile controllers that it is needed to know the
   values of wind angles (angle of attack and sideslip angle). A nonlinear
   observer for wind angles is designed using a parametric affine missile
   model developed by the authors, where the coupling term between the
   lateral and longitudinal motion is also considered. Using the wind angle
   estimate, we can design the observer-based controller to show the
   desired acceleration tracking performance. The performance and stability
   of the resulting overall missile system are analyzed by taking into
   account the effects of the wind angle estimator. Simulation results are
   also included to show that the proposed approach provides satisfactory
   performance for missile dynamics.

AB This paper proposes an observer-based method for adaptive nonlinear
   guidance. Previously, adaptive nonlinear guidance law is proposed
   considering target maneuver and control loop dynamics. However, several
   information of this guidance law is not available, and therefore needs
   to be estimated for more practical application. Accordingly, considering
   the unavailable information as bounded time-varying uncertainties, an
   integrated guidance and control model is re-formulated in normal form
   with respect to available states including target uncertainties and
   control loop dynamics. Then, a nonlinear observer is designed based on
   the integrated guidance and control model. Finally, using the estimates
   for states and uncertainties, an observer-based adaptive guidance law is
   proposed to guarantee the desired interception performance against
   maneuvering target. The proposed approach can be effectively used
   against target maneuver and the limited performance of control loop. The
   stability analyses and simulations of the proposed observer and guidance
   law are included to demonstrate the practical application of our scheme.

AB This paper presents a nonlinear observer-based sliding-mode control for
   piezoelectric actuator systems (PASs). Because not all of the states of
   the PAS are available, an observer is required to estimate the state.
   The proposed scheme contains a feedback linearization with a
   sliding-mode controller, and a state observer to estimate the velocity
   and hysteresis of the PAS. The sliding-mode control possesses an
   equivalent control and a switching control. For tracking a sinusoidal
   trajectory, the reference model with desired amplitude and phase
   features is also designed to obtain a tracking error model. Based on the
   observer and the error model, the equivalent control is designed to
   obtain the desired control behavior. Because the piezoceramic materials
   are ferroelectric, inherent nonlinearity and hysteresis always exist in
   the system. The tracking performance is attenuated due to the existence
   of the hysteresis, the modeling error and the estimation error.
   Therefore, the switching control is employed to improve the robust
   performance. The stability of the overall system is verified by the
   Lyapunov stability theory. Experiments of the PAS are also presented to
   verify the usefulness of the proposed control.

   system, can be systematically used to generate synchronized chaotic
   oscillations. While the generalized Lorenz system unifies the famous
   Lorenz system and Chen's system [10], the hyperbolic-type generalized
   Lorenz system is in some way complementary to it. Synchronization of two
   such systems is made through a scalar coupling signal based on nonlinear
   observer design using special change of coordinates to the so-called
   observer canonical form of the hyperbolic-type generalized Lorenz
   system. The properties of the suggested synchronization that make it
   attractive for the the secure encrypted communication application are
   discussed in detail. Theoretical results are supported by the computer
   simulations, showing viability of the suggested approach.

AB We present a new design scheme of nonlinear state observers (global,
   full order, asymptotic observers) through passivation of the error
   dynamics. In order to consider passivity of the error dynamics for the
   observer problem, we place a conceptual input and output on the
   generalized error dynamics which also includes the plant, and the
   strictness of passivity is extended with respect to a set in which the
   estimation error becomes zero. Then, output feedback passivation for the
   error dynamics will lead to the construction of a state observer. It is
   also shown that a nonlinear observer is generally vulnerable to
   measurement disturbance, in the sense that even an arbitrarily small
   measurement disturbance can lead to a blowup of the error state.
   However, due to the passivity of the error dynamics, the proposed
   nonlinear injection gain can be easily modified for the observer to be
   robust to measurement disturbances. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

AB A robust control is designed for a class of uncertain systems, and it is
   distinct and novel that the proposed control does not require any
   information of a bounding function on nonlinear uncertainties in the
   system. Instead, the uncertainties to be compensated for are generated
   by an exogenous system whose dynamics are either completely unknown or
   partially unknown. The only requirements on the exogenous system are
   that its unknown dynamics are bounded by a known function and that its
   output is bounded. The proposed robust control is based on a nonlinear
   observer that estimates the uncertainties. It is shown that, under
   different sets of conditions, local, semiglobal, or global stability of
   uniform ultimate boundedness or asymptotic stability can be achieved.

   of biped robots with an FNN nonlinear observer. First, a robust
   quadratic stabilization FNN nonlinear observer is presented to estimate
   the joint velocities of a biped robot, in Which H. approach and variable
   structure control (VSC) are embedded to attenuate the effect of external
   disturbances and parametric uncertainties. After the construction of the
   FNN nonlinear observer, a quadratic stabilization FNN controller is
   developed with robust hybrid control scheme. As the employment of
   quadratic stability approach, not only it afford the possibility to
   trade off the design between FNN, H-infinity optimal control, and VSC,
   but also the conservative estimation of FNN reconstruction error bound
   is avoided by considering the system matrices uncertainties separately.
   It is shown that all the signals in the close-loop control system are

   observation of a dynamical system with nonlinearities. A new
   discontinuous state observer, which is motivated by the sliding mode
   control method and adaptive techniques, is proposed for the obtained
   dynamical system. The assumptions are reasonable, and the convergence
   conditions are intuitive and have apparently physical interpretations.
   The attraction of the new method is that the algorithm is very simple
   and easy to be implemented, and it is robust to measurement noises.
   Further, minor a priori knowledge of the system is required in the new
   formulation. Simulation results show the superiority of the new method
   to the traditional ones.

   the system is decoupled through a nonlinear transformation and an
   observer is used to generate the required residual signal. By
   introducing an extra input to the observer, a direct estimation of the
   time-varying fault is obtained when the residual is controlled, by this
   extra input, to zero. The stability analysis of this observer is proved
   and some relevant sufficient conditions are obtained. Using the
   estimated fault vector, a fault tolerant controller is established which
   guarantees the stability of the closed loop system. The proposed
